Ah! I completely forgot.

that but you never do!

Mr. George Jason, Mr. Evans.

34
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,074
Hello, sir. How do you do, sir?

35
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,701
Hey, it's a tank. I
wonder who this tank is for?

36
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,828
A tank!

37
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,373
-Does it fire?
-Of course it does.

00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,919
Daddy, will you take me with you?

40
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,212
When you grow up.

41
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,381
I grew two whole inches last year.

42
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,549
But you haven't grown enough.

43
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,386
Jeroge?
-Yes, bwana?

44
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,137
Be sure and take care
of the little wimp here,

45
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,305
and his Aunty May.

46
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,890
Yes, sir, bwana.

47
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,351

64
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,881
I'm sorry, that was a near one.

65
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,050
Forget it. It happens to all of us.

66

(horn honking in distance)

67
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,681
It's a DC's car. He's way off his beat.

68
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,808
What does that mean?

69
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,810
It can only mean one thing, trouble.

70
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,158
They are waiting, bwana, waiting.

71
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,247
Calling Roy Shaw. Come
in, Roy, this is Duffield.

72
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,123
The DC told me to call
you. What's the problem?

73
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,834
Hello, Ken.

74
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,378
There's big trouble near Rumuruti.

75
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,963
White settler killed.

76
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,756
They've never struck in that area before.

77
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,007
It's getting near your house,

78
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,133
and I thought you ought to know.

79
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,886

80
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,148

(tank whirring)

82
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,545
Come along, Kenny! Time for bed.

83
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,213
Oh, no, Aunt May, five more minutes?

84
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,631
You heard.

85
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,341
Batten the window catches, Jeroge.

86
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,802
Wambui, you bolt the door.

87
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,099

88

94

(Mau Mau shouting)

95
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,684
Kenny, get out the back and hide!

96
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,353
-No, no, I'll take...
-Go on, get out!

97
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,854
Get out and hide!

98
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,525

(gunfire blasting)

103
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,044
Kenny, I'm going around to the back!

104
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,506
Get some ammunition,
Jeroge! Don't stand there!

105
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,759
(glass shattering)
(dramatic music)

106
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,595

107
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,805
Go around to the back, Kenny!

108
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,973
Why?

109
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,767
(gunfire blasting)

110
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,811
Open the other box!

111

112
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,361

(Mau Mau shouting)

114
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,406
I'll go around to the back, bwana!

115
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,323
Right!

116
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,451
(gunfire blasting)

117
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,454
(terrifying music)

118
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,209
Jeroge! No, Jeroge!

119
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,212
(gunfire blasting)

120
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,722

(mournful music)

129
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,523
I wouldn't go inside if I were you.

130
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,278
(heavy-hearted music)

131
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,586
(heavy-hearted music continues)

132
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,940
(heavy-hearted music continues)

133
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,512
Ken, one of your own men
was responsible for this,

134
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,014
a houseboy, Jeroge.

135
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,807
Jeroge?

136
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,726
We got it out of those
wounded men down there, Ken.

137
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,853
Jeroge was one of their generals.

138
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,521
Jeroge?

139
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:33,275
Ken, we'll clear up here.
You go back to Nairobi.

140
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,902
And don't get any wrong ideas.

141
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,112
Finding Jeroge is our job.

142
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,989
It was your job last night.

143
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,075
We'll get Jeroge, Ken.
You have my word for it.

144
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,076
Where's my key?

145
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,204
One of my boys will drive
you back to Nairobi, Ken.

146
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,371
Inspector!
-Sir?

147
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,000
You mustn't go taking the
law into your own hands.

148
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,752
I'm afraid you can't
come back into the district

149
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,921
until we've got Jeroge under lock and key.

150
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,551
(dramatic music)

151
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,098
Inspector, we'd better arrange

152
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,142
to have his hunter's licence revoked.

153
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,311
That'll keep him in Nairobi
until further notice.

154
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,147
(dramatic music)

155
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,076
That's the plane, all right.
We've still got time for another drink.

156
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,077
Good, I'm going to need it.

157
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,453
I'm not looking forward to this much.

158
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,705
Oh, it's not your fault
that Duffield isn't available.

159
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,415
Sir Vincent must realise that.

160
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,709
I'm afraid Sir Vincent
will only realise one thing,

161
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,919
that I was sent out here in advance

162
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,672
to get him what he wanted,
and I've lost his white hunter.

163
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,719
Ah, Brian!

164
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,054
Hello, Vincent. Hi, Linda.

165
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:44,972
Hello, Brian.

166
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,598
This is Roy Shaw, of
the African Hunters.

167
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,975
Nice of you to come and meet us.

168
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,185
-My fiancee, Miss Latham.
-How do you do?

169
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,104
Come on, the boys will
take care of the customs.

170
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,689
Just one more question...

171
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,856
Did you have a nice trip?

172
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,442
I guess so, no clouds,
no bumps, no sleep.

173
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,612
(both chuckle)
No comment. I told you I'm on holiday.

174
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,447
By the way, isn't it usual

175
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,992
for my hunter to come and meet me?
How's Duffield?

176
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,327
Well, I'm afraid Duffield's
out of the game for a bit.

177
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,787
I've got another man for you.

178
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,871
Oh, what's this?

179
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,958
Brian, I thought you cabled me
that Duffield was contracted.

180
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,418
Well, it's not his fault.

181
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,044
Anyway, the substitute is just as good.

182
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,047
-Hmm, I don't accept substitutes.
-The fact is, Vincent...

183
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,757
The facts are perfectly plain, Brian.

184
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,385
You have, in common parlance,
mucked things up again.

185
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,887
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of you as a lame dog.

186
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,139
The time is rapidly approaching

187
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,640
when I'll have to throw you to the wolves.

188
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,143
Oh, don't be so rough on Brian, Vincent.

189
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,730
What difference does it make?
I'm sure the other hunter is just as good.

190
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,606
Nobody is "just as good," Linda,

191
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,608
when I choose a hunter or a wife.

192
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,861
You should realise that.

193
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,947
You say the nicest and the
nastiest things, Vincent,

194
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,407
I get so confused.

195
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,034
Well, we don't want to hang about here.

196
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,785
Brian, find this man Duffield

197
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,038
and bring him to the hotel
at 8:00 this evening.

198
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,539
[Linda] See you later.

199
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,042
I told you before, I'm not interested.

200
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,711
I've got some unfinished
business to take care of.

201
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,670
Ken, leave it alone,

202
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,256
you can't spend your whole
life chasin' after Jeroge.

203
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,633
It's more than a one-man job.

204
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,802
You're wasting your time, Roy.

205
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,305
I've made my last safari.

206
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,223
I was out in the bush
lookin' after your client

207
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,934
when I should've been back
home lookin' after my kid.

208
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,688
Ken? Ken!

209
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,316
Your gun-bearer's outside,
says he's got a message.

210
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:24,237
(pleasant lounge music plays)

211
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,670
What did you find out?

212
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,589
Jeroge in country near Isiola.

213
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,673
How do you know this?

214
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,758
My own brother saw him.

215
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,344
He said plenty of police
hunt Jeroge all the time.

216
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,848
You get Jerusalem and O'Keefe.

217
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,226
Tell them to be ready,
we're gonna leave any time.

218
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,519
-But, bwana...
-What's the matter with you?

219
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,521
I thought you hated the Mau Mau?

220
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,356
Makora not scared, bwana.

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,359
But district commissioner
won't let bwana into Isiola.

222
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,820
You get the boys I'll take
care of the commissioner.

223
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,737
Yes, bwana.

224
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,284
300 rounds of .375,
which should be sufficient.

225
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,577
That'll do to get on with.

226
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,663
We can always send you over
some more if you need it.

227
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,164
I'll call you up on the
shortwave if I need it.

228
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,749
Charley?

229
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,835
I want to go north with you
tomorrow on your safari.

230
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,919
Don't be funny,

231
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,671
you know that country's
out-of-bounds to you.

232
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,091
I also know the police
won't search your lorry.

233
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,509
You can have me and my boys
under the tarp in the back.

234
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,219
Well, Ken, I mustn't get...

235
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,804
You can't get Charley mixed up in this,

236
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,764
he's got a wife and kids.

237
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,474
I had a family once, remember?

238
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,060
Oh, if it'd help, it'd
be different, but it won't.

239
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,020
Leave it to the police, Ken.

240
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,523
All you'll do is get yourself killed.

241
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,774
Maybe you'd be satisfied with that

242
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,235
if you killed Jeroge at the same time.

243
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,822
-There's Roy Shaw.
-Huh? Oh.

244
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,366
-Mr. Vincent, good evening.
-Hello.

245
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,617
Well, as Duffield
didn't come to the hotel,

246
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,453
I thought I'd come and look for him.

247
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,455
Is he here?
-Yes, he's at the bar.

248
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,206
Hey, Ken? Ken?

249
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,292
Sir Vincent Brampton, Ken Duffield.

250
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,086
How are you? My fiancee, Miss Latham.

251
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,629
-Hello.
-Sinden.

252
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:05,547
Ken Duffield.

253
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,757
Well, excuse me.

254
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,968
Duffield, you can spare a minute?

255
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,596
After all, I've travelled
4,000 miles for this safari.

256
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,639
Everyone in Kenya's
travelled 4,000 miles,

257
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,016
it's the only way to get here.

258
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,851
Some people had to travel 10.

259
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,395
Ah, Miss Latham's a fellow
countrywoman of yours.

260
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,646
Yes, I figured that out myself.

261
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,106
What do you drink, Sir Vincent?

262
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,066
Oh, no, don't. Brian,
you get the drinks.

263
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,735
-Let's sit down now.
-What'll you have, Mr. Duffield?

264
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,361
-Nothing, thanks.
-Duffield...

265
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,448
I came down here after a lion.

266
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,410
You got the wrong boy.
I'm out of circulation.

267
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,622
-Roy should have told you.
-That he did, but I need you.

268
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,750
All you need is a licence
and that'll cost you 10 quid.

269
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,628
But I'm after a particular lion, Hatari.

270
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,341
Where'd you hear about him?

271
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,927
Everywhere I've hunted,
I've heard about Hatari.

272
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,471
You know that you're
taking on the champ?

273
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,932
Even his name, Hatari, means danger.

274
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,683
He's the most vicious
killer in this jungle.

275
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,811
(moans) That's enough
for me. I'm going home.

276
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,146
You staying, Vincent?

277
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,064
Yes.

278
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,650
Because I want him.

279
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,026
You think that's all it takes, hmm?

280
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,736
Didn't you know, when
Vincent wants anything,

281
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,279
he always gets it?

282
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,156
That's right, Brian.

283
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,116
Do you know where to find this lion?

284
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:15,992
Yes.

285
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:17,953
The trouble is,

286
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,039
he was last seen in Mau
Mau country, near Isiola.

287
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,999
I'm not interested in local problems.

288
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,126
I'm ready to go, Mr. Duffield, are you?

289
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,378
I'm ready.

290
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,630
But there's one minor
problem, the licence.

291
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,631
I've got one.

292
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,341
I haven't. It's been revoked.

293
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,637
Of course, if anyone had
any influence of any kind...

294
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,305
Brian, go to the Governor and tell him

295
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,474
I accept full responsibility
for Mr. Duffield.

296
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,602
The safari will be in my charge
and he will answer to me.

297
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,354
You can check rifles and
equipment in the morning,

298
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,398
we'll leave at dawn the following day.

299
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,024
We'll check the rifles
and equipment tonight

300
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,360
and we'll leave tomorrow.

301
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,653
Goodnight, gentlemen.

302
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,946
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

303
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,825
Roy, I want to tell you something.

304
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,536
If I may make so bold,
who manipulated whom?

305
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,501
(people chattering indistinctly)

306
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,714
(both chuckle)

307
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,799
So my bush baby's made
another friend, huh?

308
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,301
Ooh, I'm not so sure.
(Roy chuckling)

309
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,302
-Did he bite you?
-Mm-hmm.

310
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,970
I'd like you to meet your gun-bearers,

311
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,140
Nkola, O'Keefe, and Jackson the tent-boy.

312
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,975
-Hello.
-Hey, what are you doin' there?

313
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,144
Bwana Duffield tell
me take rubber dinghy.

314
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,437
All right.

315
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,732
And this villain is Jerusalem,
camp cook and head boy.

316
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,067
When he grows up, he's
gonna be a band leader.

317
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,444
Glad to have you know me, ma'am!

318
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,237
-Hello, Jerusalem.
-Do you like music?

319
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,031
(hems and haws) Not too loud.

320
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,200
Oh, I make it good and loud, real bebop.

321
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,619
I'm some cat.

322
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,078
"By Jupiter."

323
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,539
(trumpet toots)
Jerusalem...

324
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,876
Come on, Jerusalem. Tribe?

325
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,378
-Luo.
-Date of birth?

326
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,214
19... 1940 maybe?

327
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,551
Number of wives, 4.

328
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,053
Now 5, bwana!

329
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,929
I've been in Nairobi 2 days.

330
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,765
He'll be smokin' next.

331
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,932
200 shillings a month

332
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,435
and a shilling a day posho
money when travelling.

333
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,979
Uh, make a mark there, please.

334
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,024
Bwana, Jerusalem can write.

335
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:26,915
Next, please.

336
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,669
Tribe?

337
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,838
Kikuyu. Makora knows me, he's my friend.

338
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,591
He's a good man, bwana,
I know him a long time.

339
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,135
Sorry, only take men we know. Move on.

340
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,762
Why so fussy?

341
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,055
Mau Mau's a disease

342
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,724
and they come in all sizes from 8 to 80.

343
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,479
Makora, tribe Akamba.

344
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,364
One of these days I'm gonna
put a mouse-trap in my pocket.

345
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,701
(laughs) Bwana, this time you take me?

346
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,078
I just see how you go out on safari again.

347
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,996
Try me out, eh, bwana?

348
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,541
I said come back in 10 years.

349
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,834
Come along when you're bigger.

350
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,629
Last year you said,
pretty soon I'll be big boy.

351
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,965
But you're not big
enough, next year maybe.

352
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,428
You really want to go, don't you?

353
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,389
Oh, yes, very bad me
follow bwana any place.

354
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,141
I'll fix it!

355
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,394
Mr. Duffield?
-Yes?

356
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,062
Uh, Mr. Duffield, couldn't we take

357
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,106
little, uh, what's-his-name with us?

358
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,190
We don't need him.

359
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,610
What's the matter with
you, don't you like kids?

360
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,618
Please, bwana, please!

361
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,619
Oh, please, bwana!

362
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,580
Odongo, hop in the truck!

363
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,666
(Odongo laughing)

364
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,584
Thank you!

365
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,379
Thanks, Ken, I'd have lost
that contract if you hadn't...

366
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,839
Save it, Roy.

367
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,674
You know the only reason I took this job.

368
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,051
Oh, forget Jeroge, can't you?

369
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,387
Could you?

370
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,308
All set?

371
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,477
Ready and waiting.

372
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,729
What sort of animals
do we shoot with this?

373
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,690
You can never tell
what kind of animals you might run into.

374
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,691
Good luck, boys!

375
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,652
Goodbye, Sir Vincent, and good luck.

an American in Kenya?

418
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,193
World War II, a leftover.

419
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,487
In other words, mind your own business.

420
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,821
I suppose it was a woman.

421
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,409
Ah, welcome to Africa,

422
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,412
famed for its warm hospitality
and healthy climate.

423
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,623
I don't think the climate's
too healthy, not now, anyway.

424
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,541
Oh, I have nothing to worry about.

425
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,709
In addition to you and Vincent,

426
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,836
I have a BWH to look after me.

427
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,381
Big white hunter.

428
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,549
Yeah, I almost figured that out myself.

429
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,968
Were you born friendly?

430
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,305
Or do we all get like you
after a while out here?

431
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,974
You can never tell.

432
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,476
They say that Africa does
strange things to people.

433
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,479
(gunfire blasting)

434
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,075
(gunfire continues)

435
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,424
Mau Mau?

436
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,967
Yes, gang of 30 up there.

437
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:16,931
(Mau Mau shouting in foreign language)

438
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,899
Ken, you know you're not allowed up here

439
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,901
without your hunter's licence.

440
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,319
I got my licence back.

441
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,822
That man over there can vouch for me.

442
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,948
He's got my papers.

443
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,829
(dramatic music)

444
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,480
I know you.

445
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,192
You used to work on my
farm at harvest time.

446
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,986
You're a friend of Jeroge's.

447
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,865
(dramatic music)

448
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,622
Duffield? Duffield!

449
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,167
You knew that was a Mau
Mau battle we heard.

450
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,085
That's right.

451
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,461
And you deliberately drove into it,

452
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,046
endangering the lives of all of us.

453
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,589
Vincent, after what the
Inspector just told me...

454
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,383
Linda, I'll handle this.

455
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,260
I'm sorry about your misfortune,

456
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,555
but I can't concern myself
with your personal feuds.

457
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,933
I appreciate your sympathy, Brampton.

458
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,643
But I haven't finished.

459
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,104
I engaged you as a hunter, nothing more.

460
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,146
When you've finished the job,

461
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,649
you can chase Jeroge or anything you like.

462
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,276
But until then, your one
concern is to lead me to Hatari.

463
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,402
Is that clear?

464
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,571
Very clear.

465
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,406
Because if it isn't
clear and acceptable,

466
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,243
you can leave for Nairobi
with this officer now.

467
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,662
Come on, Ken, why don't you give it up?

468
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,330
Give it up?

469
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,665
You must be crazy.

470
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,292
Sir Vincent, from now on in,

471
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,044
you've got yourself a hired hand.

472
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,088
Let's go!

473
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:26,853
(whistle tooting)
(drums beating)

474
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,331
(both greet in foreign language)

475
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,793
(drums continue beating)

476
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:56,799
Duffield?

477
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,758
(Ken speaks foreign language)

478
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:58,759
What goes on here?

479
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,053
Ceremonial dance.

480
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,055
One of the villagers
was killed last night.

481
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,057
The villager was killed by a lion!

482
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,559
What lion? Hatari?

483
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,603
I don't know whether
it was Hatari or not,

484
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,646
but it was a big one, a man-eater!

485
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:31,417
(Jerusalem playing jazzy trumpet)

486
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:44,055
(Jerusalem continues playing trumpet)

487
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:54,982
Jerusalem!

488
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,276
-Yes, bwana?
-Do you want me to lose all my clients?

489
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,986
Oh, no, bwana.

490
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,655
Better stop playing that horn.

491
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:03,741
Makora?

492
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,956
Go tell the Massai
chief I want to see him.

493
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,499
He hates the Mau Mau as much as we do.

494
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,458
Yes, bwana.

495
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,464
(precarious music)

496
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,528
(gunshot bangs)

497
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,157
What's happening?

498
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,742
[Brian] I've just had a
snake shot from over my head.

499
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,244
Snake?

500
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,161
(Linda groans)

501
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,538
If you have to sleep in the afternoon,

502
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,581
it might be safer to
do it inside your tent.

503
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,875
[Vincent] Duffield,
it's your job, isn't it,

504
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,085
to take care of your clients?

505
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,003
You know as well as I do,

506
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,171
you couldn't catch a cold from that snake.

507
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,177
Memsahib, you want something to eat?

508
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,680
Oh, Odongo, you take
very good care of me.

509
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,517
Bwana say, I don't look after
white lady, he have my ears!

510
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,935
Oh, did he?

511
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,645
Well, that was nice of him.

512
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,105
Oh, yes, bwana say

513
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,983
all white ladies little silly in the head!

514
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:19,900
Oh, did he?

515
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,863
Well, maybe so. Go on.
(Odongo laughing)

516
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,614
Can write my name too,

517
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,867
and sing "God Save Queen," want to hear?

518
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,619
Not right now. Where'd
you learn all these things?

519
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,829
Bloody missionary school.

520
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,039
Did they teach you that there too?

521
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,290
Oh, yes, good people.

522
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,292
Here you go wash your tongue with soap.

523
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,585
-Me?
-Yeah, you!

524
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,712
[Linda] Don't they
supply soap in this hotel?

525
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,546
Huh?

526
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,049
Did you hear me properly,
Mr. big white hunter?

527
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,512
-Thanks!
-(chuckles) You're welcome.

528
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,930
Give me a hand.

529
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,017
(Odongo laughs)

530
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,560
Here, wash your ears!

531
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,603
-Me?
-Yeah, you!

532
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,025
(Odongo laughing)

533
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,697
That scar above your...

534
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,033
On your back, who did that?

535
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,537
A lioness?

536
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,789
Yes.

537
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,332
Whatever happened to her?

538
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,751
She's dead.

539
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,294
Ooh.

540
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,922
Well, that washes up that
topic of conversation.

541
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,302
My ears are clean now, bwana.

542
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,929
Back to camp. Clean pants, clean shirt.

543
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,515
All right, bwana, all right!

544
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,934
White hunter, here's your soap.

545
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,563
Don't you want it?

546
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,481
Just drop it.

547
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,526
Mm, you're just full of
conversation, aren't you?

548
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,654
(chuckles) I'm not
paid for conversation.

549
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,657
Look, why don't you take
that chip off your shoulder?

550
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,076
I came here to apologise.

551
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,246
I'll remember that "don't
you like kids" crack

552
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,205
till the day I die.

553
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,249
It was a terrible thing to say.

554
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,875
There was no way for you to know.

555
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,335
I should have known.

556
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,337
No man hates another
man, as you hate Jeroge,

557
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,296
without a reason.

558
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,385
You don't like us, do you?

559
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,680
I'm not paid to like you.

560
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,266
If it wasn't for the
money, you wouldn't be here?

561
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,184
Let's put it this way,

562
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,728
I'm not here because of
your beautiful blue eyes.

563
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,315
Look, I'm not making a pass at you,

564
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,528
(chuckles) though I can
see how you might think so.

565
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,157
Ex-chorus girl engaged to rich
man meets Big White Hunter,

566
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,199
how could you miss?

567
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,078
But as hard as it may
be for you to believe,

568
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,246
I like Vincent,

569
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,832
and I enjoy being the
future Lady Brampton.

570
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,001
Who are you kidding?

571
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,837
Outside of money, what's he got?

572
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,547
The best of everything.

573
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,008
The finest jade, beautiful tapestries,

574
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,093
and a wonderful collection of paintings.

575
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,597
Has he told you which wall
he's going to hang you on yet?

576
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,514
Linda?

577
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,893
It's time you came back
and dressed for dinner.

578
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,484
It's nice of Duffield
to look after Linda like that, isn't it?

579
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,074
(relaxing music)

580
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,873
(Jerusalem clears throat)

581
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,416
Dinner on the beam, bwana?

582
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,375
[Brian] We just wanted
to say what to say

583
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,376
what a very good dinner it was.

584
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,629
-Good, good.
-[Linda] It was lovely.

585
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,130
-It was cool.
-Thank you, thank you.

586
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,131
In fact, it was real gone.

587
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,591
You think so?

588
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,219
Bwana, maybe you think dinner so good,

589
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,304
you give permission for a small practise?

590
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,724
A few hot licks, yeah? (laughs)

591
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,685
Maybe tomorrow, when
we're far away from camp.

592
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,688
Thank you, bwana. Thank you. (laughing)

593
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,069
(hyena chattering)

594
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,699
(Ken laughs)

595
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:59,662
You'll get used to the
hyenas in the jungle.

596
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,665
(chuckles) I did, years ago.

597
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,666
That's all over.

598
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,710
By the way, I don't
think I told you, Linda,

599
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,379
how pretty you look in that dress.

600
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,588
Thank you.

601
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,132
Even if it is a little
out of place here.

602
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,889
I think I catch on.

603
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,474
My first safari, you know.

604
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,768
Bwana! Buzz buzz, 9:00!

605
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,895
He means they're calling me on the air.

606
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,813
See you later.

607
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,863
(call signal beeping)

608
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,247
Can I come in and sit down?

609
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,498
There's only the bed.

610
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,210
Look, junior, I didn't say lie down.

611
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,380
Calling Nairobi. Hello, Nairobi.

612
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,008
Calling Roy Shaw.

613
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,843
Come in, Roy. This is Ken Duffield.

614
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,513
[Roy] Hello, Ken. Hello, Ken.

615
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,058
Now this is important, make
sure you're on your own.

616
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:08,355
Make sure there's no one listening. Over.

617
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,525
-Okay, Roy, shoot.
-Hello, Ken, there's been a roundup

618
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,485
of Mau Mau in Nairobi today.

619
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,529
Hundreds of them have been questioned

620
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,698
and they found out something.

621
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:22,661
One of your safari boys has
taken the Mau Mau oath. Over.

622
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,788
That's impossible, Roy.

623
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,249
These boys have been with me for years.

624
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,793
Hello, Ken, we don't know which it is,

625
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,545
so don't trust anyone.

626
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,589
Be on your guard. Out.

627
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,887
How will you find out who it is?

628
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,515
It's extremely important

629
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,225
that no one else hears about this.

630
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,226
Do you understand?

631
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,813
I understand.

632
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,661
(Linda gasps and screams)

633
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,871
Mau Mau! Do something!

634
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,456
Mau Mau!

635
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,124
Stop screaming.

636
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,417
You might frighten them.

637
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,880
-Jambo!
-Jambo, bwana.

638
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,424
Relax, everyone. They're
our friends, can't you see?

639
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,094
-Who are they?
-They're Massai.

640
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,137
(groans) First time
I was ever frightened

641
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,972
out of a full bottle.

642
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:25,683
-Makora?
-Bwana?

643
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,518
See that everyone sleeps
with their rifles tonight,

644
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,269
you understand?
-Yes, bwana.

645
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,063
What's this, more Mau Mau scourge?

646
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,315
You know as well as I do,
they're not interested in strangers,

647
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,651
it's only settlers they attack.

648
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,568
Maybe so.

649
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,863
But you're gonna get
a rifle just the same.

650
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,533
I'd suggest that you sleep
with them under your mattress.

651
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,535
If you lose them, it's 250 pounds fine

652
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,161
plus 6 months in jail.

653
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,247
And that goes for little girls, too.

654
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,833
Don't worry about me.
I'll just throw my bottle.

655
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:54,253
(Ken and Brian chuckle)

656
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,256
[Ken] What'd you find out?

657
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,384
Chief says Jeroge came
near here three nights back.

658
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,095
Police had a big fight,
took plenty of prisoners.

659
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,096
But not Jeroge, bwana.

660
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,598
-Jeroge get away.
-Where is he?

661
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,560
No one knows, but he cannot be very far.

662
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,354
Jeroge won't get away from me this time.

663
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,440
Have the chief send out trackers
right away to look for him.

664
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,400
But, bwana, how will
you explain to the others

665
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,776
why we stay here?

666
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,821
Bwana Vincent is in a big hurry
to move on and find Hatari.

667
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,032
Tell the chief to put on a
lion hunt tomorrow morning.

668
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,993
That should keep them quiet for a day.

669
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,494
(local speaks foreign language)

670
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,912
Makora...

671
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:29,830
Bwana?

672
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,958
One of our boys is a Mau Mau.

673
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,877
Do you know who it is?

674
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,088
I thought I could trust every one of them.

675
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,132
You can trust me, bwana.

676
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,884
I know that, Makora.

677
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,177
Thank you, bwana.

678
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,428
I'll keep my eyes open.

679
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,814
(drums beating)
(dramatic music)

680
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,584
(drumbeat continues)
(dramatic music continues)

681
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:28,013
I say, it's remarkable,
nothing but spears!

682
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,181
Part of the ritual.

683
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,062
Until a Massai's killed a lion that way,

684
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,855
he hasn't proved he's a man.

685
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,398
I can think of better ways.

686
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,614
Go and see if the chief
has found out anything.

687
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,782
Yes, bwana.

688
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,289
(lion growling)

689
00:38:55,875 --> 00:39:00,838
(drumbeat continues)
(dramatic music continues)

690
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,639
(lion growling)

691
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:25,529
(drumbeat continues)
(dramatic music continues)

692
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,502
(lion roars)

693
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,720
(men shouting)

694
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,064
(dramatic music intensifies)
(men cheering)

695
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,361
Let's go.

696
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,238
-Why now?
-The show's over.

697
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,742
(hunters sing and chant)

698
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,709
Bwana!

699
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,793
What'd you find out?

700
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,378
Massai chief say he found out

701
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,006
Jeroge now hiding on Makoma Rock.

702
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,049
That's about an hour from here.

703
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,050
Yes, bwana.

704
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,844
If we leave now, we can
get back before they miss us.

705
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,185
(duplicitous music)

706
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,090
Bwana, fresh tracks.

707
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,389
Makora, he's probably
in those rocks up there.

708
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,057
Get behind me and cover me.

709
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,225
Yes, bwana.

710
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:26,358
(Jackson mimicking bird call in distance)

711
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,903
(intriguing music)

712
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,370
(Mau Mau speaking foreign language)

713
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,708
(Jackson speaks foreign language)

714
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,963
(Mau Mau speaking foreign language)

715
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,339
(Jeroge speaks foreign language)

716
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:54,344
(Jackson speaks foreign language)

717
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,139
(dramatic music)

718
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,477
(Jeroge speaks foreign language)

719
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,564
(suspenseful music)

720
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,997
(suspenseful music continues)

721
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,665
Wait, don't fire!

722
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:30,130
(suspenseful music continues)

723
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,508
(Ken grunts)

724
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,676
Get him!

725
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,221
(dramatic music)

726
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,974
(gunshot bangs)

727
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,146
(gunfire blasting)

728
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:52,861
(gunfire continues)
(dramatic music continues)

729
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,788
You get back to camp. We go north.

730
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:11,213
He got away this time, but
I'll get that filthy scum

731
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,964
if it's the last thing I ever do.

732
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,558
Duffield! Duffield!

733
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,147
Where have you been?

734
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,774
I was looking for Hatari.

735
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,192
I don't believe you.

736
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,194
This is your last safari, Duffield.

737
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,779
A hunter that leaves his camp unprotected

738
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,697
from Mau Mau men...
Unprotected?

739
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,616
You were here, weren't you?

740
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,575
Besides, I thought you weren't

741
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,993
concerned with local problems.

742
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,079
I am concerned with you
doing what I tell you.

743
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,080
You're under my orders.

744
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,998
Stop your squawking.

745
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,209
You want Hatari, that's what you'll get.

746
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,710
Ken? Mr. Duffield?

747
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,046
Yeah?

748
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,383
Could I speak to you for a moment?

749
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,427
What's your beef?

750
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,138
I'm dreadfully sorry, but I...

751
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,557
Well, go on!

752
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,433
I've lost my rifle.

753
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,310
-You what?
-Well, I left it on my bed.

754
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,812
The whole country sweats its guts out

755
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:09,813
to keep arms from the Mau Mau

756
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,523
and you come along and give
it to them on a platter.

757
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:15,443
You miserable incompetent!
Why didn't you tell me?

758
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,238
I don't mind your making
a fool of yourself,

759
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,115
that's your function in life,

760
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,117
but now you're making a fool of me.

761
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,994
(scoffs) Get back into
your tent and stay there.

762
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,996
I'm sick to death of the sight of you!

763
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:37,090
Why don't you kick his
teeth down his throat?

764
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,468
It's not as simple as
that. Vincent's a killer.

765
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:45,098
Oh, no, nothing violent. He's
much more subtle than that.

766
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,728
He finds out your weaknesses
and he plays on them.

767
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,856
Have you got any weaknesses, Duffield?

768
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,483
I'm loaded with them.

769
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,735
Not gambling, I hope?

770
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,030
Vincent loves gamblers.

771
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,615
He loves to help them,

772
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,241
help them dig a hole for themselves.

773
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:06,077
And then when they're in so
deep and there's no way out,

774
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,415
no honest way, that is, he saves them,

775
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:12,918
on certain conditions.

776
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,338
Anyway, I am sorry about that rifle.

777
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,132
Forget it.

778
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,009
Probably one of my own boys took it.

779
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,511
Good night.

780
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,518
Why don't you have one for the road?

781
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,900
(glass shatters)

782
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,944
You'd never get a job with the Dodgers.

783
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,661
Bwana want anything?

784
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,703
No thanks.

785
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,084
Say, Odongo, did you fix this for me?

786
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,169
No, memsahib, she fix.

787
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,964
She think maybe bwana be hungry.

788
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,508
Well, that was very
nice of her, wasn't it?

789
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:06,179
Bwana treat memsahib very bad,
she fix nice drink for bwana.

790
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,097
(Odongo scoffs)

791
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,642
I get it. Bwana stick
big foot in big mouth, huh?

792
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,977
That's right, bwana big chump!

793
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,687
You (laughs) fresh kid!

794
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,189
(both laugh)

795
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,832
(cautious music)

796
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,169
Can I have another one?

797
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,213
The one you threw me is a little muddy!

798
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,177
Okay.

799
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:47,846
You'll have to help yourself, though,

800
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,306
I wasn't expecting company.

801
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,645
(warm music)

802
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,024
Did you get him?

803
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,401
No.

804
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:03,778
He got away.

805
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,702
I'm sorry.

806
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,204
(book thuds)

807
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,709
(warm music continues)

808
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,306
Did you ever play football?

809
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:34,601
No.

810
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,271
I... I thought not.

811
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,025
Your book.

812
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,574
Good night.

813
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,370
Good night.

814
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,049
(ominous music)

815
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,775
(men snoring)

816
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,616
(alarming music)

817
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:40,583
Bwana, bwana! I can't
find Jackson in camp.

818
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,377
He must have stolen the rifle.

819
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,711
He must be the Mau Mau.

820
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:47,424
First it's Jeroge, now it's Jackson!

821
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,883
All right, Makora,

822
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,510
tell everybody to sleep
with their clothes on.

823
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,553
Yes, bwana.

824
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,268
Memsahib?

825
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,227
What is it?

826
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,813
Bwana says everybody better get dressed.

827
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,981
Why, what's the trouble?

828
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,274
No trouble, memsahib,

829
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,860
but bwana wants everybody keep eyes open.

830
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,572
All right, Makora, thank you.

831
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,498
(sneaky music)

832
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,641
(dramatic music)

833
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,478
(Jackson grunts)

834
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,198
(campers chattering)

835
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,494
Jackson?

836
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,287
He came back. (breathing heavily)

837
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,123
I tried to hold him, but he got away.

838
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:05,084
I hurt him real bad, bwana.

839
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:05,960
I'm sorry.

840
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:09,923
What the devil was that?

841
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,174
Jackson's escaped. He's a Mau Mau.

842
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,717
We've got to go on after him.

843
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,887
-What is it?
-I don't know. It's...

844
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,180
What's the matter?
What's the matter, bwana?

845
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,723
Look, hot licks, you and
Odongo stay here in camp

846
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,891
and take care of Miss Linda.

847
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:20,808
Here.

848
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,730
(suspenseful music)

849
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,586
(suspenseful music continues)

850
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,556
[Newscaster] Tomorrow's
weather will be fine.

851
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,976
Good hunting, everybody, and good night.

852
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,649
(wistful music)

853
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:38,720
(suspenseful music)

854
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,276
(owl screeching)

855
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:58,239
(suspenseful music continues)

856
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,596
(wistful music)

857
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,901
(ominous music)

858
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,117
(intriguing music)

859
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,667
(ominous music)

860
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:05,139
(Linda screaming)
(dramatic music)

861
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,022
(Linda groans)

862
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:17,151
(Linda groaning)

863
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,953
(pan thuds)
(Linda grunts)

864
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,788
By golly, by golly.

865
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,131
Does it hurt?

866
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,841
(Linda groaning)

867
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:40,758
Memsahib!

868
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,433
Don't worry. Don't worry,
you'll be all right.

869
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:51,686
(disconcerting music)

870
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,609
(gunshot bangs)

871
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:01,654
(Linda whimpering)
-Linda! Linda!

872
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:02,780
Are you all right?

873
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:06,451
Don't pretend to
start worrying about me.

874
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,954
Can't blame me if
Duffield lets a Mau Mau...

875
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,372
For heavens' sake, Vincent,
this is no time to start...

876
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:12,457
Oh, why don't you shut up?

877
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,001
Stop it! Don't you see she's hysterical?

878
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:18,212
(Linda whimpers)

879
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,819
Thought you'd gone off with the others.

880
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,654
No, Ken and Vincent agreed
that I should stay here

881
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,698
and act as camp policeman.

882
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,159
Oh, well, at least they're
on the same side for once.

883
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,745
Though, I think for
rather different reasons.

884
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,039
Sir Vincent wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

885
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,209
Exactly what did you mean by that crack?

886
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,169
I think it's all this subversive talk

887
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,505
about the things Africa does to people.

888
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:02,799
Perhaps Vincent's worried
that you're beginning

889
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,468
to see things straight for the first time.

890
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,677
I know I am.

891
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,679
Have you ever tried saying what you mean

892
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,598
without using double-talk?

893
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,016
All right.

894
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,185
Linda, you're a nice person, very nice,

895
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,603
you ought to stay that way.

896
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,315
But you won't unless you get
away from Vincent, and now.

897
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,027
Brian, I want to marry Vincent.

898
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,362
Let's leave it like that.

899
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,113
All right.

900
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,282
Now why don't you go
get me another drink?

901
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,116
Oh, Linda.

902
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,743
Why not? You said I could
handle my liquor well.

903
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,286
Oh. All right.

904
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,635
(birds fluttering)

905
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,687
You're wasting your time
putting out bait for Hatari.

906
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,939
Only scavengers eat dead meat.

907
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,607
Bwana! Come, quick!

908
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:05,736
Look!

909
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,449
That's a big lion.

910
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,034
Big enough to be Hatari?

911
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,160
Let's go see.

912
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,001
Memsahib! Memsahib!

913
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,461
Well, Odongo, what have you
got to be so excited about?

914
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,213
I catch big fish for memsahib!

915
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,548
Really? Let me see!

916
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,341
Come here, I'll help you.

917
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,094
Hmm, let me look.
How nice! I think I'll try my hand at it.

918
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,054
Bwana said no go on the river, please!

919
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,931
No, no, no, memsahib!

920
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,058
Memsahib! Memsahib!

921
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,894
Memsahib! No, no, memsahib!

922
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:38,853
Memsahib!

923
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,730
Memsahib! Memsahib!

924
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,316
Bwana!
Bwana! Bwana!

925
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,444
Bwana! Memsahib go fishing in the river!

926
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:47,820
Gone fishing?

927
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,698
(panicked music)

928
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,707
Linda, come back, you fool!

929
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,625
Come back!

930
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,134
(carefree music)

931
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,187
(elephant trumpeting)

932
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:37,787
(imposing music)

933
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,838
(lion growls)

934
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,849
You haven't got a
prayer at this distance.

935
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,977
I ought to know, Duffield.
I make these things.

936
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,853
That's what the telescopic sight's for.

937
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,773
I know, but if you miss,
I've got to go in that bush and get him.

938
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,400
Don't worry, Duffield,

939
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,944
I've come a long way for
that lion, I won't miss.

940
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,742
(gunshot bangs)

941
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,536
You brute.

942
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,912
Uh, I'm sorry, Duffield.

943
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,665
That's great, lover boy.

944
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:43,894
(birds chirping)

945
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,785
(foliage rustling)

946
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,185
(lion roars)

947
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,257
(lion roars)

948
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,327
(lion panting)

949
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,829
Ken!

950
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:25,913
Ken!
-Bwana!

951
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:30,751
It's Linda!

952
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,253
She's drifted down the
river in the dinghy, alone.

953
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,796
-What?
-My wounded lion's in there.

954
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,548
Linda can take care of herself.

955
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,676
(carefree music)

956
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,012
(elephants trumpeting)

957
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:49,520
(distressing music)

958
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,236
(hippos snorting)

959
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,542
(panicked music)

960
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,507
(fearsome music)

961
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:40,321
(fearsome music continues)

962
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:00,925
(panicked music)

963
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:11,143
(rapids rumbling)
(panicked music continues)

964
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,938
[Linda] Help!

965
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,445
Oh, hurry! Help!

966
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,241
(tense music)

967
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,245
Help! Help!

968
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:34,166
(waterfall rumbling)

969
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,886
(tense music continues)

970
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:06,365
(tense music continues)

971
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,874
(gunfire blasting)

972
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:31,223
(gunshot bangs)

973
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,566
(gentle music)

974
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,333
Was that the big white hunter?

975
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,585
Haven't you been in enough water,
for the last couple of days?

976
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,378
This is a bath!

977
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,379
You sent for me?

978
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,342
Yeah, two things.

979
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,510
I wanted to thank you for today.

980
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:09,428
Part of my job.

981
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,557
And I wanted to ask
you, could we go back?

982
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,311
Brampton gives the orders
around here, you know that.

983
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:19,897
It's him I'm worried about.

984
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,818
(sighs) This mania about killing a lion,

985
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,279
maybe it's because he's sick.

986
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,114
He's always been sick.

987
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,283
Only out here, you can
see it much plainer.

988
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,745
Look, all I wanted to know
was whether we could go back?

989
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:37,998
Go back to what?

990
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,442
-Good morning.
-What are you going to do?

991
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,403
I suppose you'll have to
go after that lion again.

992
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,738
I have to, it's wounded.

993
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:10,781
What would happen if a hunter didn't

994
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,783
follow up a wounded animal?

995
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,118
He'd lose his licence.

996
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,497
Are you feeling all right?

997
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,498
I'm perfectly all right.

998
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,083
These are just a precaution.

999
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,001
Are you sure you don't want to go back?

1000
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,337
I'll say when I want to go back.

1001
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,755
Okay, it's your funeral.

1002
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,216
Well, I have a feeling that

1003
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,385
you're not going to shoot
that lion after all.

1004
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,386
What are you talking about?

1005
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,471
Well, you heard what
Ken said, didn't you?

1006
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,557
Now it's wounded, it's his job.

1007
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,558
He said that, did he?

1008
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,475
Yes.

1009
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:43,981
Did he?

1010
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,733
(ominous music)

1011
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,198
-Makora?
-Yes, bwana?

1012
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,616
Tell bwana Duffield
that I'm ready to go.

1013
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:55,826
Yes, bwana.

1014
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,833
(ominous music)

1015
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,604
Okay, let's go!

1016
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,941
Haven't you messed
things up enough already?

1017
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,485
I can take care of the kill.

1018
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,030
No, Duffield, I'll
take care of the kill.

1019
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:39,536
(engine turns over)
(ominous music)

1020
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:57,679
(lion roars)

1021
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:00,599
(dramatic music)

1022
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:13,320
Bwana! Bwana! (speaks foreign language)

1023
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,156
(dramatic music)

1024
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,410
(gun clicks)

1025
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:23,288
(rhino grunting)

1026
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:28,377
(gunshot bangs)
(rhino squealing)

1027
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:38,845
(rhino squealing)
(Makora screaming)

1028
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,602
(gunshot bangs)

1029
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,899
(sombre music)

1030
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,377
(disconcerting music)

1031
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:26,810
(Jerusalem speaks in foreign language)

1032
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,646
(mournful music)

1033
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:02,179
("Swing Low, Sweet Chariot)

1034
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,870
Duffield, tell him to stop
that blasted trumpeting!

1035
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,374
Sorry, but I want my men to forget

1036
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,792
what happened to Makora.

1037
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:32,793
Any objections?

1038
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,045
No, give the boy's family
whatever you think's right.

1039
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,381
It's more than you've
got or ever will have.

1040
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,258
It was my fault that Makora was killed.

1041
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:42,344
It wasn't because my magazine was empty.

1042
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,846
I knew from the first day I met you all,

1043
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,640
you'd be nothing but trouble.

1044
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,350
Well, I've had all I'm gonna take.

1045
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,645
You're leaving tomorrow
morning for Nairobi. Got that?

1046
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:55,607
Listen, Duffield, I've had
enough of your insubordination.

1047
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,860
This safari ends when I finish
off Hatari, and not before.

1048
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,153
But tomorrow morning at daybreak,

1049
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,322
you're heading south
for Nairobi, non-stop!

1050
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:05,992
And how about you, our big white hunter,

1051
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:08,120
risking our necks so he
can get his own revenge,

1052
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,122
-what's he going to do?
-I'm going to stay here

1053
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,624
and clean up the mess your
lover boy left behind.

1054
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,011
(metal clanging)

1055
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,486
Hot Licks!

1056
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,949
Oh, it's you, bwana.

1057
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,367
How do you like my new hat?

1058
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,495
Who sent you that, Hedda Hopper?

1059
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,580
(Jerusalem laughs)

1060
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,748
Shh. Keep your eyes open.

1061
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:53,957
Okay, bwana.

1062
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,668
One for the road, Duffield?

1063
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,339
(soft music)

1064
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,259
Why don't you get some sleep?

1065
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:07,554
Um... Not yet, not plastered enough.

1066
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,473
Such stuff as dreams are made on.

1067
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:11,933
Try a dream, Duffield. No extra charge.

1068
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,185
No thanks.

1069
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,061
Good for you, Mr. BWH.

1070
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:17,856
I loathe people who don't
know when they've had enough.

1071
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,111
Hate to see me do this, don't you? Why?

1072
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,363
That's your problem.

1073
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,364
But I asked you.

1074
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,951
Well, from where I stand,

1075
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,745
it don't exactly help the picture.

1076
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,456
Funny, from where I drink,

1077
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,792
it's always made the
picture look much better.

1078
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:43,799
Ken, sit down, please?

1079
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:56,520
This is the last time we'll
ever see each other alone.

1080
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,649
I wanted you to know something.

1081
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,778
This is the last drink I'll ever take.

1082
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,698
I need it now so I can blame
it for what I'm going to say.

1083
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:15,163
I love you, Ken, I always will.

1084
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,918
No need for you to say anything,

1085
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,920
because this is all there is to it.

1086
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:28,051
(sighs) I've said it,
and I feel great for it.

1087
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:34,516
I hope some day you'll get
that hate out of your heart,

1088
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,310
so you can say it to someone.

1089
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,898
(hopeful music)

1090
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,490
I need some sleep.

1091
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,583
(pensive music)

1092
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,676
Bwana! Bwana!

1093
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:11,511
Buzz buzz!

1094
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,018
Calling Roy Shaw!
Come in, Roy, this is Duffield.

1095
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:20,312
District commissioner's orders.

1096
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,355
You've got to move camp.

1097
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,942
200 Mau Mau broke jail this afternoon,

1098
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,987
20 miles south of you at Isiola,

1099
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,156
and they're heading towards your area,

1100
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,408
probably to join up with Jeroge.

1101
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,995
Now, Ken, I know how
you feel about Jeroge,

1102
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,164
and why you're staying in that area.

1103
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,666
But my feeling is that
you should move north

1104
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:42,709
as soon as you can.

1105
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,254
-Hot Licks!
-Bwana?

1106
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:47,756
Load the trucks we're
leaving right away.

1107
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,715
Okay, bwana!

1108
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,050
Okay, come on, trucks!

1109
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,304
(engine turns over)

1110
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,181
[Brian] Say, Ken, what's happened?

1111
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,058
I thought you said we weren't leaving
until tomorrow morning.

1112
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,018
I've changed my mind. We're leaving now.

1113
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,394
Get your gear.
-Why?

1114
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,522
Duffield, I'm not leaving
here till we finish off Hatari.

1115
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,568
Look, there's 200 Mau Mau
around here somewhere on the loose.

1116
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,946
I'm takin' this safari outta here.
If you want to stay, stay!

1117
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:13,490
Odongo! Odongo...

1118
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:16,368
You there, unload that truck!

1119
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,287
I say when this safari
leaves, not Duffield.

1120
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,081
Sorry, bwana, can't do it.

1121
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:28,880
Why aren't you dressed?

1122
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,090
Why is everything changed?

1123
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,341
Why are we heading north?

1124
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,593
200 reasons, all of them Mau Mau.

1125
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,512
But the Mau Mau and Jeroge
are what you're after,

1126
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,889
and you're giving it all up, why?

1127
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,265
Because you're my
favourite football player.

1128
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,266
Now get dressed.

1129
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,521
I won't be 5 minutes!

1130
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,568
(men chattering outside)

1131
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,826
(fabric ripping)

1132
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:09,045
Bwana, come quick!

1133
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,213
What's your problem?

1134
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,048
Look! Look!

1135
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,719
Unpack my big Express
and 900-grain bullets.

1136
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,346
Hey, hot Licks? Hatchets and ropes!

1137
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,348
Vincent's gone?

1138
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,891
The stupid fool's
out there in the jungle

1139
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,685
in the middle of the night.
-He must be raving.

1140
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,395
-Shall I come with you?
-No, you stay here.

1141
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:26,438
And keep your rifle in your hand.

1142
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,815
Don't leave no matter what happens.

1143
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:29,733
Thanks.

1144
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:35,864
(dramatic music)

1145
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,838
If you want to stay alive, keep behind me.

1146
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:56,301
(lion roars in distance)

1147
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:05,435
(gunshot bangs)

1148
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,897
Brampton! Brampton!

1149
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,733
(dramatic music)

1150
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:36,049
Stay where you are, Duffield!

1151
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:41,262
Stay where you are, or I'll shoot.

1152
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,139
Take cover, he's crazy with fever.

1153
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:45,850
Don't be a fool, Brampton.

1154
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:47,685
Stay where you are, I say!

1155
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,062
The lion's mine!

1156
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,817
(gunshot bangs)
(bullet ricochets)

1157
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:54,776
(gun cocks)

1158
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,070
Now do you believe that I mean what I say?

1159
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:59,906
Nobody wants to stop you
from killing that lion.

1160
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,575
I only want to stop you from
getting yourself killed.

1161
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:04,369
Look.

1162
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,751
(gunshot bangs)
(bullet ricochets)

1163
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:14,170
(gun cocks)

1164
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:38,194
(dramatic music)

1165
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,990
Don't move, Brampton.

1166
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,700
Do what I tell you.

1167
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,577
What do you think you're trying now?

1168
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:49,080
Brampton, there's a lion over your head.

1169
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:50,582
It's less than 20 feet away.

1170
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,584
You can't fool me with that old trick.

1171
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:56,546
When I give you the word, turn and fire.

1172
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,132
(tense music)

1173
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,635
Shoot!
(lion roaring)

1174
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,388
(gunshot bangs)

1175
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,309
(gunshots bang)

1176
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,729
(dramatic music)

1177
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,147
Did I get him?

1178
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:16,191
Did I get Hatari?

1179
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,108
You got him.

1180
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:20,820
Jerusalem!

1181
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:22,030
-Bwana?
-Stretcher.

1182
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,657
O'Keefe, stretcher!

1183
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,830
I hope that's enough
morphine to keep him out.

1184
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,165
Will he live?

1185
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,584
All depends on how fast we get there.

1186
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:35,627
That means going south.

1187
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,086
You understand what that means, don't you?

1188
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:38,004
I understand.

1189
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,256
Ken, if there's no other way

1190
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:41,966
but to go through Mau Mau country,

1191
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,635
hadn't we better stay here?

1192
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,554
Sorry, old man, but we
gotta take that chance.

1193
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,431
Jerusalem! Let's go!

1194
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:51,434
(Jerusalem speaks foreign language)

1195
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:54,187
(onerous music)

1196
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:10,787
-What is it?
-I don't know.

1197
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,996
Looks like the police.

1198
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:17,377
We've been lookin' for Mau Mau.

1199
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,045
Can you take us to the
police station, please?

1200
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,589
Hop in and tell the
others to get in the truck.

1201
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:25,927
(officer speaks foreign language)

1202
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,598
(onerous music)

1203
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,529
(ominous music)

1204
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:07,135
(gunshot bangs)
(bullet ricochets)

1205
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,770
(gunshot bangs)

1206
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,732
(explosion booms)

1207
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:32,410
(Jeroge shouting in foreign language)

1208
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,581
(Mau Mau clamouring)

1209
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:46,007
(gunshot bangs)

1210
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,801
(dramatic music)

1211
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:53,890
(Mau Mau clamouring)

1212
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:57,226
(heart-pumping music)

1213
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:01,898
Hurry, Jerusalem, bring that ammunition!

1214
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:02,982
Re-load this!

1215
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,366
Keep your heads down!

1216
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:14,452
(Mau Mau clamouring)

1217
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,793
(automatic gunfire blasting)

1218
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:27,715
(gunfire blasting)
(Mau Mau shouting)

1219
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:40,895
(gunfire continues blasting)
(shouting continues)

1220
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:49,695
(gunfire pauses)

1221
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:51,781
Fire!
(gunshot bangs)

1222
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,784
(bullet ricochets)

1223
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,955
(uneasy music)

1224
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,709
(birds squawking)

1225
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,170
What are they waiting for, Ken?

1226
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,422
Darkness.

1227
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:08,381
It won't be long.

1228
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:09,382
How many casualties?

1229
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:12,802
One boy killed, two very
badly hurt, one askari dead.

1230
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:15,680
Well, it could have been worse.

1231
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,141
What about Nairobi, Ken, the radio?

1232
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,809
Closed circuit.

1233
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,103
They don't open that
unit till 9:00 tonight.

1234
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:24,772
We'll tell 'em we're
here if we're still here.

1235
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:28,693
Bwana? (speaks foreign language)

1236
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:29,652
(Ken speaks foreign language)

1237
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:31,446
(officer repeats Ken's response)

1238
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,489
He's trying to through for help.

1239
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:41,247
(ominous music)

1240
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:50,047
(gunshot bangs)
(dramatic music)

1241
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,925
(gunfire blasting)
(Mau Mau groans)

1242
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,761
(dramatic music)

1243
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:03,227
Where's Odongo?

1244
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:04,645
Isn't he with Jerusalem?

1245
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,147
Haven't seen him anywhere.

1246
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,943
-Jerusalem!
-Could that kid be a Mau Mau after all?

1247
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,321
Of course not, not possibly.

1248
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:14,780
You don't think so?

1249
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:16,949
I'll bet he thought the same about Jeroge.

1250
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,162
(dramatic music)

1251
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,194
Jerusalem, get that tyre fixed!

1252
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:56,697
I could probably get you
all out of here on the truck

1253
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,491
before they close in.

1254
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:01,369
Brian, you drive. Jerusalem
and O'Keefe will be with you.

1255
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:02,411
Where will you be?

1256
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:03,788
When you get in, you send help back.

1257
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,122
That your best idea?

1258
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,375
-That's it.
-You'll have to do better.

1259
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,627
Because if it's the end of the road,

1260
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,921
so it's the end of the road.

1261

1262
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:19,720

(brooding music)

1273
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,915
Don't waste any ammunition!

1274
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:40,635
How is he?

1275
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,428
-Get me out!
-Vincent, lie down!

1276
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:43,262
Do-do-do you hear me? Get me out!

1277
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:44,138
Do-do-do you hear me? Get me out!

1278
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:45,097
Don't worry I'll get you out of here.

1279
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:47,516
If you don't get me out
of here, I'm finished.

1280
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,773
(ominous music)

1281
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,525
They are coming!

1282
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,069
Get the car started, Brian.

1283
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:02,573
(suspenseful music)

1284
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:09,080
(gunshot bangs)

1285
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:12,541
-Please lie down, please?
-Ken!

1286
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:13,918
No, I'm not going!

1287
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:19,006
Ken, I'm not going! Ken!
(Ken mutters)

1288

1293
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,702

That was close!

1297
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,671
There's one more chance,
the truck's up there.

1298
01:26:58,755 --> 01:26:59,714
-No, Ken, I won't go!
-Go ahead, Linda,

1299
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,340
