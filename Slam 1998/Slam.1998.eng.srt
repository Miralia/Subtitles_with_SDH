that this defendant

It's not a random set
of numbers, son.

380

a little bit

500,000 people

388
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,921
Now only 70 percent
of them are Black.

389
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,590
Now what's 70 percent
of 500,000?

390
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:49,385
Do the math. We got about
350,000 Black people in DC.

391
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,347
Of the 350,000, half of them
are female, aren't they?

392
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,475
What's that?
Use the math, son, the math.

393

75 to 80 thousand adult males

00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,652
You know what I’m saying?
Do you know what I’m saying?

686
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,153
I mean, it's not about...

687
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,781
It's hard to be
yourself here, man.

688
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,533
Look around, man.

689
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,202
It's hard to be yourself
in here, man.

690
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,000
My crew gotta know
where you stand.

691
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,042
I know where they standing at.

692
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,544
What the fuck, nigga?

693
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,045
This ain't no rites
of passage or some shit.

694
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,380
Ain't nobody gonna cross
that shit.

695
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,173
You see them lined up?

696
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,011
We got our shit
locked over here.

697
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,887
Ain't nobody coming over here,
fucking with this shit.

698
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,556
There's a place
for you over here.

699
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,683
If not, go the fuck over
there with your friend, then.

700
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,067
All right, look,

701
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,737
let's not get too close,
you know what I mean?

702
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,954
It's going down.

703
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,706
-It's going down today.
-It's going down today.

704
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,041
It's going down today.

705
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,501
He gots to go.
Hopha got his corner.

706
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,087
He gots to go.
He gots to go.

707
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,881
Pass that joint.

708
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,675
I want everybody high.
Everybody high.

709
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,052
I want everybody high.

710
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,845
It's the thug in us.

711
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,727
Fuck you.

712
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,897
I stand on the corner
of the block

713
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,774
Slinging
amethyst rocks,

714
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,568
drinking 40's of Mother
Earth's private nectar stock

715
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,861
Dodging cops

716
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,613
'Cause five-oh be the 666

717
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,448
And I need a fix
of that purple rain

718
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,118
The type of shit that
drives membranes insane.

719
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:44,079
Oh, yeah, I’m in the fast
lane, snorting candy yams

720
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:47,624
That free my body and soul
and send me like Shazam

721
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,502
Never question who I am
God knows

722
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,170
And I know God personally

723
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,090
In fact, he let's
me call him me

724
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,050
Yeah, I'm serious B.

725
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,511
Doggonned niggas plottin'
shit, lovely,

726
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,305
But the Feds
is also plottin' me

727
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,724
They're tryin'
to imprison my astrology

728
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:08,103
Put our stars behind bars,
our stars in stripes

729
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,939
Using blood-splattered
banners as nationalist kites

730
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,858
But I control the wind

731
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,442
That's why they
call it the hawk

732
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,320
I am Horus, son of Isis,
son of Osiris

733
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,031
Worshipped as Jesus,
resurrected like Lazarus

734
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,534
but you can
call me Lazzie, lazy,

735
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,161
Yeah, I’m lazy,
cause I'd rather sit

736
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,954
and build than work
and plow a field

737
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,206
Worshipping a daily
yield of cash green crops

738
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:32,210
Stealing us was the smartest
thing they ever did

739
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,422
Too bad they don't teach
the truth to their kids.

740
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:38,049
Our influence on them
is the reflection they see

741
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,759
when they look into
their minstrel mirror

742
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,595
And talk about
their culture

743
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,972
Their existence is that
of a schizophrenic vulture

744
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,099
Yeah. There's no repentance

745
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,852
They are bound to live an
infinite consecutive

746
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,395
Executive life
sentence

747
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,063
So what are you
bound to live, nigga?

748
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,232
So while you're
out there serving the time

749
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,360
I'll be in sync with the sun
while you run from the moon

750
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,113
Life of the womb
reflected by guns

751
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,532
Worshiper of moons
I am the sun

752
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:06,411
And we are
public enemies number one

753
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:11,666
One, one, one
One, one, one.

754
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,720
I forgot what
the fuck I was thinking.

755
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:38,235
Are you all right?

756
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,112
-Are you okay?
-Um, yes.

757
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,572
I just saw what you
did out there.

758
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,243
Do you need any help?

759
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,787
-No.
-You're cool?

760
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,208
Um, hi.
My name is Lauren.

761
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,961
Lauren Bell.
I teach writing here.

762
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,549
Where did you get that from?

763
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,385
I’m sorry, um...

764
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,804
The poem that you did out there.
Did you, did you write that?

765
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,848
Yeah.

766
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,058
-Excuse me.
-Um...

767
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,935
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I’m fine.

768
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,603
What are you doing
out here in the hall?

769
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,231
He's just talking to me.
He's on his way to...

770
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,024
Okay. But he's not supposed
to be out here.

771
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,694
North three, let's go.
Right now. Right now.

772
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,613
You have no right to be
out here. Let's go.

773
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,782
All right you're in north three.
I’ll put in a request for you.

774
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,285
I’ll put in a request for you.

775
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,328
You have to tell the CO
that you want to come to class,

776
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,290
and he'll let you come down.

777
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,041
You are out of place.
Let's go.

778
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,219
I’ve been searching
myself, man.

779
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,141
I know you all have too.

780
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,435
The world is fucking
leaving us behind, man.

781
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,353
What Ray said was right.

782
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,272
I didn't agree with his methods,
you know what I'm saying?

783
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:59,524
-You know...
-What the hell was that?

784
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,694
I still don't fuckin'
know entirely, man.

785
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,446
But what that nigga did
out there

786
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,197
was just fucking fascinating.

787
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,012
I ain't fucking coming
back here, man.

788
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,473
Fuck that shit.
I love y'all and all that shit.

789
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,600
I ain't coming
the fuck back here.

790
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,227
You know what I mean?
I ain't turning on y'all.

791
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,979
Like I said, I love y'all,

792
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,733
but I'm telling it
the way it fucking is, man.

793
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,777
Them motherfuckers
outside this glass

794
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:46,029
don't give a fuck about us.

795
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:49,366
We started off fighting,
we gonna end off fighting.

796
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,826
But how we fight is the fight.

797
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,829
That's the way it goes.

798
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,623
If I’m gonna die
for something,

799
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,708
I'm gonna die for something
that's worth it, dig?

800
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,146
We've been discussing
the chapters

801
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,815
as we've been
going along...

802
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,985
but now we've finished
the whole book.

803
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:29,739
And what I want to know is...

804
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:36,371
what came to
your mind last night

805
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,666
when you were lying in your cell

806
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,335
and you were
reading the assignment?

807
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,130
What was the first thing
that came to your mind?

808
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,632
I mean, sure, I know I want
to stay on the street.

809
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:52,512
I know I want to be a positive
person to my family, right.

810
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,974
But I know that, me personally,
if the situation arose

811
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,186
where it was either starve
or my children starving,

812
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:04,149
or doing the right thing,
then, you know, it's Trey Ball.

813
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,650
It's got to be.

814
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,569
Or Monster Kody got to
do what he got to do.

815
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:11,072
I do not agree with Joseph.

816
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:14,492
Sadly, too many of our brothers
got the mentality of Joe,

817
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,162
and come here and say,
because of this and that,

818
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:20,665
I’m gonna put this in my hand
using my family for an excuse.

819
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,167
When all the time,
like you said,

820
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,918
you got to
be responsible for you.

821
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,587
So you gonna use, "My family was
hungry so I went out

822
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:26,963
and shot a motherfucker,
take some money."

823
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,882
Fuck no.
You still coming to jail.

824
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,383
I don't know whether
you know it or not, brother,

825
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,968
but we are capitalists.

826
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,471
Whether we're capitalists
on a small scale,

827
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,764
but we live in
a capitalist country.

828
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,349
And that is what we are.

829
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,519
We are born to learn how
to capitalize on whatever it is.

830
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,729
It's about money.

831
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,689
So Joe and John
are saying that

832
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,608
there are not enough
resources out there

833
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:49,986
to help you change your life.
Is that true?

834
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,323
We just happened
to be born our color,

835
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,492
and we at the bottom of
the ladder. You understand?

836
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:59,245
Now, if I could make it out,
and have me some real dough,

837
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,331
yeah, then it wouldn't
be like this.

838
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,333
All right. Y'all ready
for the poetry reading?

839
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,251
Yes.

840
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,836
I didn't hear everybody.

841
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,588
I said are y'all ready
for the poetry reading?

842
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,381
Yes.

843
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,884
-Tyrone, you ready?
-Yeah.

844
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,135
Let's go.

845
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:22,810
The name of
my little piece is, uh, "Why."

846
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:28,066
"I shot three motherfuckers,
but I didn't know why.

847
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:32,195
"I guess I just wanted
to see something die.

848
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:36,241
"You see, I bought this gun
for a few rocks

849
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:41,871
"just to get even, so I thought,
with those shit-eating cops.

850
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:46,000
"Holding the cold, blue steel
in the palm of my hand,

851
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:49,796
"not quite sixteen,
yet totally a man.

852
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,757
"My only plan was
money in my hand.

853
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,553
"I wore Falacci, Gucci,
Nikes, and Eddie B.

854
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,597
"I was the coolest
motherfucker in Southeast D.C.

855
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,561
"School? What the fuck.

856
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,813
"That was a thing
of the past.

857
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,607
"Getting paid, school and
all that other square shit

858
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,569
"could kiss my ass.

859
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,572
"Mad at my bun,
toying with my gun,

860
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:19,117
"tipped on over to my favorite
poolroom just to have some fun.

861
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:22,870
"Rips was at full blast,
so I chalked up my cue,

862
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,872
"ready to kick some ass.

863
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:28,376
"I played a few hours,
beat all the old timers

864
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,169
"and was about to go.

865
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,965
"Until the three...

866
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,969
"One of the three 'bama
motherfuckers stepped on my toe.

867
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,597
"A split second later,
whip, bam, it was on.

868
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,891
"The ass kicking begun.

869
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:48,313
"I ducked a few pool balls
and eased out my gun.

870
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:52,483
"Ratta-tat-tat and that was
that. Three was whacked.

871
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,068
"Ten years later.

872
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,613
"As I sit here in my
jail cell about to cry,

873
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,281
"I’m thinking,

874
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,408
I shot three motherfuckers
and I don't know why."

875
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,286
[applause]

876
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,415
Thank you, Ron.

877
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:12,337
Oh, I, um, I don't know
if all of you guys know,

878
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:16,341
but, um,
today's my last day here.

879
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,384
No.

880
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,721
Oh, God.

881
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,265
I’m gonna miss you guys.

882
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,269
-We gonna miss you, too.
-Especially me.

883
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,855
Um, they, um,

884
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,358
it's so wild that we had this
conversation today, because,

885
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:37,111
they have,
they cut this program.

886
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,449
And it's just brought home
the fact that, you know,

887
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,494
it really isn't about
rehabilitation anymore.

888
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,789
You know?
And you were right, Joe.

889
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,332
Like I was trying
to tell you earlier,

890
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,043
yeah, it's gonna be hard
when you leave here.

891
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,420
It's gonna be real hard.

892
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:57,215
It's really fucked up that
you were born in Southeast,

893
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,883
in the ghetto.

894
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,260
It's really fucked up
that you were born Black.

895
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:02,679
It's really fucked
up that you've had

896
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,555
the hard time
that you had in your life.

897
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,432
Whatever your story is,

898
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,601
whatever it is that brought
you here in your life,

899
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,561
that shit is really fucked up.

900
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,814
If you keep shoving the anger
and the pain

901
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,649
and the frustration down,

902
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,025
and you keep
saying that's all right,

903
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,902
fuck it, I’m-a do what
I gotta do

904
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,571
and you don't let it come out,
that keeps pushing you down.

905
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,782
That is your prison.

906
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,325
You gotta let that shit out

907
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,952
'cause once you let
that frustration out,

908
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,204
it doesn't hold
you back anymore.

909
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,706
It doesn't lock you down.

910
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,290
And then you can stand up
with some courage.

911
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,501
You can say, okay,
yeah, it's fucked up,

912
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,545
but I am not gonna
live like this.

913
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,589
I am going to take my destiny
into my own hands.

914
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,592
That's the only way to go now.

915
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,803
I grew up with guys
just like y’all.

916
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,555
All of y'all.

917
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,349
My brother was sitting
in your seat.

918
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,184
My brother's not here anymore.

919
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:55,022
He grew up in your era,
Joe, in your era, Ronald,

920
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:58,693
when everybody wanted to
be Superfly. Remember that?

921
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,946
It was all about being Superfly
or the Mac, remember that?

922
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,865
Now it's about being
a gangsta or OG.

923
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,745
He had a good heart
just like y'all.

924
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,413
I know y'all are good guys.

925
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,331
The people out there,
they see your face in the paper,

926
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,668
they think y'all,
they think you're monsters.

927
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:19,005
I know you're good guys inside.
My brother had a good heart.

928
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,387
I know your dreams.
I've been there.

929
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,766
But chasing them, thinking you
can achieve them

930
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,685
by selling drugs...

931
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,312
that's just a part
of the trap, y'all.

932
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,064
That's just a part of the trap.

933
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,775
And yeah, you're right, Ronald.

934
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,902
The cycle just
keeps continuing.

935
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,362
Who's gonna stop it?

936
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,948
Y'all got to stop it.
Y'all been in.

937
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,075
Y'all can go back out,
change your life

938
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,744
and show the young brothers

939
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,829
that they don't have to
come back in here like this.

940
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:57,585
Freedom isn't out here.

941
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,338
It's in here.

942
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,715
You can be free
anytime you want.

943
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,969
Anytime.

944
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:10,515
Never give anyone

945
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:13,684
the power to take
away your freedom.

946
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:18,272
That's yours. It don't belong
to nobody but you.

947
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:20,942
Remember that.

948
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,573
I’m not going to go
on and on.

949
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,076
Besides, my tissue's
falling apart.

950
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,954
-We gonna miss you, all right?
-I'm gonna miss you too, Red.

951
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,998
And I’m gonna miss you too.
And I’m gonna miss you too.

952
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,167
-Give me a hug.
-All right. All right.

953
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,836
I hate bye-byes.

954
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,045
All right, all right.

955
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,547
I hate bye-byes.

956
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,383
Reggie, give me a hug, baby.

957
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,094
-Okay.
-You gonna be okay?

958
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,430
I’m gonna be all right.
You gonna be okay?

959
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:54,433
I'm gonna be fine after
that poem you wrote.

960
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,768
You gonna write me now, right?

961
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,019
I promise.

962
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,855
Okay. Good.
All right, now.

963
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:01,190
Take care, baby. Bye-bye.

964
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,695
Ray, you hangin'
back for a minute?

965
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,822
Mm-hmm.

966
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:10,116
So what did you think
of the class?

967
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,871
I think you're a wonderful
teacher.

968
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,956
Ray, what are you
doing in here?

969
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,416
I sold weed.

970
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,337
So you just happened
to be selling weed?

971
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,172
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know.

972
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,799
I got caught.

973
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,385
Yeah, I know you got caught.
I know you got caught.

974
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,847
I mean, it's that simple.
It's not...

975
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,768
-I mean...
-What, are you in school?

976
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,312
No.

977
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:42,899
So you sell weed for a living?
That's it?

978
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,067
And you write poetry.
And you read books.

979
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,278
I never really thought of
myself as writing poetry.

980
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,947
You know, I write,
I'm here on,

981
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:54,535
I'm really here on
a petty weed charge.

982
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:59,707
Although, I’ve been told
that I have to cop a plea.

983
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,587
And if I do,

984
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:08,215
I may be looking at
like a couple of years,

985
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:11,218
but... I don't know.

986
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,226
-I don't know how to say...
-Just stay in touch.

987
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,354
Just stay in touch.

988
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:27,443
You never know.
You never know, you know?

989
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,074
I gotta go.

990
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,969
You got me thinking.

991
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,929
You remember that book
that was in my cell?

992
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:59,141
"The Art of War?"
Guy named Sun Tzu.

993
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,812
Some old guy.
Chinese guy a long time ago.

994
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:06,816
The man said it's about
learning to lead people.

995
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:11,696
It's about being able
to win wars without violence.

996
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:12,863
You know what I mean?

997
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,323
He wasn't no sucker, now,

998
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,534
he'd get ready
to get down, you know?

999
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,288
But he won wars
from the beginning

1000
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,290
without ever having
to use violence.

1001
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,292
He said that's where
the real battle is.

1002
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,628
Shit bugged me the fuck out.

1003
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,588
I thought what the fuck's
this nigga talkin' about?

1004
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,215
I mean, I thought about it.

1005
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,384
But how many people
really do that, you know?

1006
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,220
How many people really do that?

1007
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,973
You did that.

1008
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,516
I’m telling you, man,

1009
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,269
you got more talent
than maybe even you know.

1010
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,021
You got a hell of a
lot of decisions.

1011
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,981
I can't help you
with the decisions, man.

1012
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,734
You know, but I’m always
there for you.

1013
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,778
I've made my decisions, yo.
You can see.

1014
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,822
There's no fear in
my heart no more.

1015
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,073
There's no fear.

1016
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,742
I don't give a fuck.

1017
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,578
I’m scared every day,
but I’m not afraid.

1018
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,664
You dig?
To me there's a difference.

1019
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:08,377
To you there's a difference.
You showed that.

1020
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:09,837
You gonna be a great man.

1021
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,465
You got great things
to fucking do.

1022
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:18,387
And one of them is to pass
this to an old friend of mine.

1023

01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,587
as a muted trumpet.

1188
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:20,924
Bluer than a cloudless sky,
bluer than a Viking's eye.

1189
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,677
You see, love is
a blue-bottle fly

1190
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,178
flitting between
blue and green.

1191
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,764
Wings raggedy as
a pair of old jeans.

1192
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,143
Merci beaucoup.
Love is Winnie the Pooh

1193
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:33,854
doing voodoo in
corrective shoes.

1194
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,982
[laughing]

1195
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:40,068
-Yo, you write?
-Um, a little bit.

1196
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,904
Oh, okay.
You gonna kick a piece later?

1197
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,865
Um, I don't know.

1198
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,283
Yeah, he's gonna
kick a piece later.

1199
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:49,161
I have a million things
going on in my head.

1200
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,538
Oh, okay.
Oh, so you gonna free-style?

1201
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,249
No.

1202
01:10:54,375 --> 01:11:00,172
His intergalactic free-style
jazz licks... my ears.

1203
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:03,759
As I ride his tongue and groove

1204
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:09,389
to the sound of chords
no man has ever touched.

1205
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,851
His touch tempts me to taste

1206
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:16,480
flesh of my flesh
from which he is made.

1207
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,399
His invisible strokes are felt

1208
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:23,111
as he stands on
the stage in front of me.

1209
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:27,324
A mic and a million
miles away from me.

1210
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,618
Everything is kind of new now.

1211
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,828
Like I wouldn't want to read
anything I'd written before.

1212
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,246
It's too old.

1213
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,209
It's nice to have
you on the outside, truly.

1214
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,002
It's good to be on
the outside. Truly.

1215
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,962
It's all right.
I'm not tripping.

1216
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:44,925
You massage the universe's spine

1217
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:46,718
the way you twirl
through time

1218
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,846
and leave shadows on the sun.

1219
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,893
My love is the wind song.

1220
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:58,814
If it is up to me,
I’ll never die.

1221
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,983
If it is up to me, I’ll die
tomorrow a thousand times

1222
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,236
in an hour
and live seven minutes later.

1223
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,988
If it is up to me, the sun
will never cease to shine

1224
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,532
and the moon will
never cease to glow

1225
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,784
and I’ll dance a
million tomorrows

1226
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,202
in the sun rays of
the moon waves

1227
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,996
and bathe in the
yesterdays of days to come,

1228
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:18,291
ignoring all of my afterthoughts
and preconceived notions.

1229
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:23,004
If it is up to me,
it is up to me.

1230
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,424
And thus, is my love.
Untainted.

1231
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:29,928
Eternal.

1232
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,931
The wind is the moon's
imagination. Wandering.

1233
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:37,602
It seeps through cracks,

1234
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:41,273
ripples the grass,
explores the unknown.

1235
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:46,152
My love is my soul's
imagination.

1236
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,281
How do I love you?

1237
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:52,200
Imagine.

1238
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,704
I can't believe
you actually came.

1239
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:02,460
Glad I came.
Very glad I came.

1240
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:03,795
I have thought of you.

1241
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:08,049
Um, and, um...

1242
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,219
What else?

1243
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,681
What else is there?

1244
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:19,728
Today, now.

1245
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:22,814
There's tomorrow.

1246
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,816
And the next day and the next.

1247
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:26,109
Not today.

1248
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,655
-Not now.
-Yeah. Well...

1249
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:33,408
Tomorrow and the next day
and the next for me

1250
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,870
is not exactly like...

1251
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,668
I’m sorry, I mean...

1252
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,962
-Ray...
-If, if you want me to go...

1253
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:49,090
I don't know what I want you to
do to be quite honest with you.

1254
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,928
Um, today you're here.

1255
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,639
Tomorrow and the next day,
I mean, you still,

1256
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,391
you still have to go to court.

1257
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:03,188
I mean, you still have
to possibly, um, go away.

1258
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:07,984
I still have to try to get back
into prison to do my job.

1259
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,278
No. I really can't.

1260
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,950
I can't go there right now.
I just can't.

1261
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,496
It's really difficult, Ray.

1262
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,207
Who you telling?

1263
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:25,627
You made an
impression on me.

1264
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:27,879
And, um, it's funny,

1265
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:31,758
I wasn't certain of when
I'd be able to see you again.

1266
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,303
But...

1267
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:40,934
This is all I’m asking for, now.

1268
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,612
Thank you.

1269
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:02,974
Hey, this'll do.

1270
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,398
Look at the little one
with the ponytail.

1271
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:40,136
So you coming to
the slam tonight?

1272
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:43,098
Um, I don't know.
I may.

1273
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:46,142
-You should.
-I want to.

1274
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:49,104
You should. You should.
I can get you up on stage.

1275
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:54,025
I just, yeah. I'm not trying,
I'm not thinking about performing.

1276
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:57,028
I need to think.
You know, I just...

1277
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:59,614
I have to go
to court on Monday.

1278
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,535
Wow, that soon?

1279
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,912
Damn, you just got out.

1280
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,545
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

1281
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,674
I have no clue.
I need time to think it over,

1282
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,344
'cause I can't see what it is
I'm supposed to be doing now.

1283
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,054
None of this makes sense to me.

1284
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,895
You only have until
Monday though, right?

1285
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,605
-Yes. I only have...
-What did your lawyer say?

1286
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:35,859
My lawyer told me to cop a plea.

1287
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,527
He told me that's
the best thing I should do.

1288
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,112
He said if I fight it,

1289
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,531
I’ll probably just end up
getting more time.

1290
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:45,660
-It's...
-What's, what's your charge?

1291
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,622
Possession of illegal substance.

1292
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:51,833
Are you guilty?
Did you do it?

1293
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,836
I had it on me.

1294
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,757
What's going to be
is going to be.

1295
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:02,051
You stand up and you face it.

1296
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,012
It's a lot to face.

1297
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:06,181
It's a hell of a lot to face...

1298
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,185
...for some weed, you know.

1299
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,936
Man, they caught you with
the shit red-handed.

1300
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,022
-What are you gonna do? Run?
-No, I...

1301
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:17,108
I think there has
to be another way out.

1302
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,861
I pray there has
to be another way out.

1303
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:23,948
Copping a fucking plea?
That shit is not my way.

1304
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,868
I can't, I can't feel that shit.
I can't see that shit.

1305
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,828
Wait a minute. You acting
like you did not do this shit.

1306
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,623
Like copping a plea would
be like lying to yourself.

1307
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,458
Well, you...
you did that shit, Ray.

1308
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,252
I did do the shit, but I don't
feel guilty about it.

1309
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,837
I don't feel guilty.

1310
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,089
I'm sorry,
but I don't feel guilty.

1311
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,424
But you did it.

1312
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,218
So the fuck what?
I don't care.

1313
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,929
-I did it. I did it.
-Yeah.

1314
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:48,014
But what the fuck did I do?
And what are they doing to me?

1315
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,392
What the fuck is the punishment
for that shit?

1316
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:54,646
There, there has
to be magical doors.

1317
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:56,981
I’m looking for
the fucking magical doors.

1318
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:59,651
That's what I need.
That's what I need.

1319
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:01,819
That's what's gonna get me
out of this shit, you know?

1320
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:06,574
I mean, yesterday, I sat...
I woke up in a fucking prison.

1321
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,869
I woke up on a fucking ship.
I woke up there, you know?

1322
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:13,414
I woke up there.
And then I went home.

1323
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,251
And I saw that for what it was.

1324
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,254
And then, I came here,

1325
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,924
and it was like, it was like
a fucking new world to me.

1326
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,926
It was a new world.

1327
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:27,220
And I was like, ah,
this is fucking home.

1328
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:28,846
This is where I need to be.

1329
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:30,974
This is the shit that I've
dreamt about, you know?

1330
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,558
This is the shit
that I can feel.

1331
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,435
This is the new world
that I want.

1332
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,062
But I don't want to
have to go to

1333
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,606
the fucking middle passage
to get to the new world.

1334
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,108
That's not for me.

1335
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,825
Look, Ray, all I’m saying
is you made a mistake, baby,

1336
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,785
I mean we all make mistakes.
I’ve made mistakes.

1337
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:53,955
All you got to do is
just walk up in that court

1338
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:57,208
with your head up high.

1339
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,711
Accept responsibility for
what you've done. Go to jail.

1340
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:01,879
Do your time.
Make the most of your time.

1341
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,506
Read, write, do whatever
it is you gotta do...

1342
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,301
What the fuck are you saying?
What are you saying?

1343
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:09,429
No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't class now.

1344
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:12,265
My only responsibility
is to my fucking dreams.

1345
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:15,727
You know what I’m saying?
That's my responsibility.

1346
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:17,645
Not to no other shit
like that.

1347
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:18,980
You know, I...

1348
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,190
This is a part of
your dreams, Ray.

1349
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:22,817
You cannot have your
dreams if you don't--

1350
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:24,235
This is not a part of
my fucking dreams.

1351
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,696
This is not no fucking metaphor.
This is my life.

1352
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,698

01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:04,690
Run, free.

1522
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,400
My back is against a brick wall.

1523
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:08,903
I got a Mac truck two
inches from my face!

1524
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,947
Well run free, baby.
Run now.

1525
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:15,367
It just looks hard,
but it would be so easy.

1526
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,703
Just turn around and go.
Clip all the wires,

1527
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:19,788
hookups and hangups,
and then you're home free.

1528
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:22,791
You can give birth
to an excuse so easily,

1529
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:24,335
you'll believe
it's always been there.

1530
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:25,794
Part of the natural order,

1531
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:27,671
made to order by your
forever clever mind.

1532
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:29,965
Constantly protecting you
against things you no longer

1533
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,675
need to be protected from.

1534
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:35,971
And I believe.
I believe like a Holy Roller,

1535
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:38,098
singing, sweating, preaching,
go tell it on the mountain,

1536
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:39,975
while speaking in twenty
different tongues,

1537
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:41,769
while diving in ten thousand
feet of baptismal water

1538
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,520
without a life preserver.

1539
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,856
I believe like my bullet-ridden
brother out there somewhere

1540
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:48,525
right now gurgling blood
through his last breath,

1541
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:51,946
spitting out a red ripe prayer
so new, so sweet, so baby fresh,

1542
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:55,950
so full of truth, he
thinks it can save his life.

1543
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:58,702
God does not exist
in desperation

1544
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:01,830
and hope is lying dead somewhere
in the sewer down the street,

1545
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:03,958
around the corner, in the alley,
underneath the feet of somebody,

1546
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:07,086
itching, scratching, trembling,
jonesing for their next hit

1547
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:09,672
and sucking somebody's dick.

1548
01:31:09,756 --> 01:31:12,257
I got two minutes, y'all.
I got two motherfucking minutes

1549
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:15,135
before I run free or die, y'all.

1550
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:18,430
Two minutes
before I smash my face

1551
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:19,974
into the grill
of a Mac truck.

1552
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:23,727
Before I get ten thousand
bricks shoved up my ass.

1553
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:26,897

1557
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:41,036
Lauren Bell. Lauren Bell.

1558
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:44,248
Get her back up here.
I need an encore.

1559
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:46,333
I need an encore.

1560
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:50,838
You know what? You know,
it's about spreading love.

1561
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:54,049
And I met somebody
recently who, um,

1562
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,635
who touched me, who moved me.

1563
01:31:56,761 --> 01:32:00,431
And I hope he does
the same thing for you.

1564
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:03,600
Um, this is his
first time reading,

1565
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:06,812
and he's a big, big talent,

1566
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,148
and he needs our
love and our support.

1567
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:11,066
And I give you, Ray.

1568
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:13,360
Come on up here, Ray.
Come on, baby.

1569

Come on.

1570
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,157
Yeah, come on, Ray.

I am that nigga.
I am that nigga.

1595
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:59,800
I am that timeless nigga that
swings on pendulums like vines

1596
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:03,637
through minds of booby-trapped
minds that are enslaved by time.

1597
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:06,890
I am the life that
supersedes lifetimes, I am.

01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:09,810
It was me with serpentine hair
and a timeless stare

1599

that with immortal glare
turned mortal fear

1600

into stone time capsules.

They still exist
as the walking dead as I do,

1602
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:17,693
the original suffer-head,

1603
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:19,862
symbol of life and
matriarchy's severed head.

1604

Medusa, I am.

I am that nigga.
I am that nigga.

1606

I am that nigga.
I am the Negro.

1607
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,286
Yes, Negro.
Negro from necro.

1608
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:29,663
Meaning death. I overcame it,
so they named me after it.

1609
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:31,707
And I’ve been spittin'
at death from behind

1610
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,458
and putting "kick me"
signs on its back.

1611
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:36,003
Because I am not the son
of sha clack clack.

I am before that.
I am before.

1613

I am before before.
Before death is eternity.

1614
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:43,468
After death is eternity.
There is no death.

1615
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:45,012
There's only eternity.

1616
01:34:45,138 --> 01:34:47,181
And I be riding on
the wings of eternity like,

1617
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,808
ya, ya, ya,
sha clack clack.

1618
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:51,393
But my flight
doesn't go undisturbed

1619
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:55,147
because time makes dreams defer
and all of my time fears

1620
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:56,857
are turning my days
into daymares.

1621
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,483
And I live daymares
reliving nightmares

1622
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:00,360
that once haunted
my past sha clack clack.

1623
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:02,112
Time is beatin' my ass.

1624
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:04,239
And I be having dreams of
chocolate-covered watermelons

1625
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:06,575
filled with fried chickens
like pinatas.

1626
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,452
With little pickaninny
sons and daughters

1627
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:11,205
standing up under them with big
sticks and aluminum foil,

1628
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:12,456
hittin' them trying
to catch pieces

1629
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:14,249
of fallen fried
chicken wings.

1630
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,043
And Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben
are standing in the corners

1631
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:17,878
with rifles pointing at the
heads of the little children.

1632
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,796
"Don't shoot the children!"
I shout.

1633
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:21,548
"Don't shoot the children!"
But they say, "It's too late.

1634

They've already been
infected by time."

1635

I need more time.

1637
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,347
But it's too late.

1638
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:30,140
They start shooting at the
children and killing them.
