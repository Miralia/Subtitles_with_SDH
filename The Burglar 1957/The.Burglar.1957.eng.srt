1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,045
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,975
Everybody loves a parade,

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,854
and the Chinese Nationalists
on Formosa are no exception.

4
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,273
An impressive display
of modern military might

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,401
passes in review for
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek

6
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,363
in a dramatic demonstration
of readiness in the Far East.

7
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,492
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:41,207
In Miami Florida, belles
work out with dumbbells.

9
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,626
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,378
And if they have any energy left,

11
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,464
they try a few tricks on the pogo sticks.

12
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,716
(upbeat music)

13
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:54,637
They do this by the hour,
seeking that hour glass figure.

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,265
(upbeat music)

15
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,269
Philadelphia, the city of homes.

16
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,520
The city of brotherly love

17
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,981
is the scene of dedication ceremonies

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,566
that will turn the palatial mansion

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,985
of dead millionaire Bartram Jonesworth

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,988
into a spiritual research
centre for Sister Sarah,

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,825
who is widely known for her
remarkable occult revelations.

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,201
In order to start a movement

23
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,036
that would put within
the reach of everyone,

24
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,038
the tremendous untapped resources

25
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,541
of the collective spiritual, unconscious,

26
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,585
devoted followers of Sister Sarah

27
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,753
have showered her with the money and gifts

28
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:31,549
so necessary to transform
a vision into a reality.

29
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,051
Now, for a few words from Sister Sarah.

30
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,928
Excuse me a moment, please, Sister Sarah,

31
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,639
won't you say something
for our newsreel audience?

32
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,475
They're all interested to
know just how you feel.

33
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,644
Well, I should like to say a few words

34
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,105
about the late Bartram Jonesworth.

35
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,649
Well, feel perfectly free to do so.

36
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,902
When Batram Jonesworth first
came to me six years ago,

37
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,573
he said, quote, "I do
not believe in charity."

38
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,160
"I am a businessman," unquote.

39
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,079
So I made an agreement with Mr. Jonesworth

40
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:07,126
that I would never ask him for
a donation, not even a dime.

41
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,421
However, if he wished to sell something,

42
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,882
I'd be glad to talk business.

43
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:18,054
For these automobiles,
I paid Mr. Jonesworth

44
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,515
the total sum of 85 cents.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,436
For this fur I'm wearing, 40 cents

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,483
and this priceless necklace, 60 cents.

47
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,778
And finally, this magnificent mansion,

48
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:38,866
this 17 acre estate,
the price asked was $1,

49
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,285
not a cent more.

50
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,247
I think this all proves something

51
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,543
that while Barton Jonesworth
did not believe in charity

52
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:54,799
as a businessman, he
was very, very generous.

53
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,760
(upbeat music)

54
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,974
(audience applauds)

55
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,644
(upbeat music)

56
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,933
(train whistling)

57
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,939
(train engine revving)

58
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:41,697
(soft music)
(birds chirping)

59
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,262
(bell dings)

60
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,642
(soft music)
(birds chirping)

61
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,976
Hello.

62
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,645
[Butler] Hello.

63
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,480
What can I do for you?

64
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,483
I wanna see Sister Sarah.

65
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,360
[Butler] What about?

66
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,736
I wanna make a donation.

67
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,530
[Butler] Oh.

68
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,114
(birds chirping)

69
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,867
(TV chattering)

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Sister Sarah?

71
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,795
What is it, my child?

72
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,298
(birds chirping)

73
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,842
(coins jingle)

74
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,762
Thank you sister
Sarah, thank you so much.

75
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,266
(birds chirping)

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,726
Tell me, did you have lunch?

77
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,187
(birds chirping)

78
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,899
Well, you are having lunch
with me and dinner too.

79
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,151
Now come along, come along.

80
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,821
(door opens)

81
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,947
How'd you make out?

82
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,532
(footsteps approaching)

83
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,242
-It's cased.
-Good girl.

84
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,869
I told you she could handle it.

85
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,372
Boy, that's some castle she's got there.

86
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,165
I got tired counting the rooms.

87
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,792
The layout. What's the layout?

88
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,129
It looks good, there's only one hitch.

89
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,256
We'll have to time it to the split second.

90
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,258
You have exactly 15 minutes.

91
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,968
What do you mean 15 minutes?

92
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,386
What's this 15 minute business?

93
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,138
We got to talking about this and that,

94
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,849
and she tells me she's
crazy about John Facenda.

95
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,183
John Facenda?

96
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,352
He's a news report on
television, he's on every night.

97
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,021
At 11 o'clock for 15 minutes.

98
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,065
All right, so every night
she watches John Facenda

99
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,318
and he's on for 15 minutes. So what?

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,944
The television sets
downstairs, upstairs

101
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,446
Will you get to it?

102
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,449
Where does she keep the necklace?

103
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,536
In her bedroom in a wall safe.

104
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,623
(papers ruffling)

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,209
(soft music)

106
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,253
[Baylock] I don't know.

107
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,380
I don't know, that ain't much time.

108
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,550
Especially not on this
one, our first big job.

109
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,636
(soft music)

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,722
(suspenseful music)

111
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,768
(car engine revving)

112
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,270
(soft music)

113
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:19,980
30 Seconds.

114
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,567
Would you cut it out?

115
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,111
-Cut what out?
-You're breathing down my neck.

116
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,074
20 seconds.

117
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,827
18, check the light.

118
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,706
(crickets chirping)

119
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,419
[Producer] 10 Seconds. Mr. Facenda.

120
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,047
Settle down, boys.

121
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,426
Standby please.

122
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,097
(feet jumping)

123
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,183
(crickets chirping)

124
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,118
Russia said today that it
rejected a recent US offer

125
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,787
of surplus farm products
because America refused

126
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,999
to include any strategic
goods in the deal.

127
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,418
The official news agency
said that a commercial treaty

128
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,045
was annulled by the United
States several years ago

129
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,714
and accused the United States of erecting

130
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,549
international trade barriers.

131
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,219
(window opens)

132
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,221
We got a new round of hard bargaining

133
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,265
on each west arm cut.

134
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,268
The proposals were in one
blueprint from Russia,

135
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,728
two from the west.

136
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,105
After three weeks of
preliminary introductions,

137
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,774
the real negotiating is expected soon.

138
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,444
After the five power
talks reconvene today.

139
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,406
Most details of the plans
have been leaked to the press

140
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,491
by formal announcements, by delegates,

141
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,828
or through publication and
official communist newspapers.

142
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,081
Even though this is a
so-called secret conference.

143
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,293
Cape May, New Jersey, coast guard,

144
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,462
bethels from New York
deliver with Delaware,

145
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,630
searched today for a Navy aeroplane

146
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,424
with three men aboard, which vanished

147
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,718
in last night's windstorm.

148
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,220
The missing crash is a
Twin-engine Beachcraft,

149
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,931
which left El Toro, California.

150
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,975
Last night the pilot of the craft reported

151
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,312
that it was about 15 miles
northwest of Red Bank

152
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,273
and had sufficient fuel
for three more hours.

153
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,484
The pilot gave no indication of trouble.

154
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,110
Western Statesmen were pleased

155
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,820
with the construction progress

156
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,907
of the unified air rate
screen across Western Europe

157
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,825
from Norway to Turkey.

158
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,786
The defence ministers of NATO predicted

159
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,663
that the jam proof communication
and warning network

160
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,708
will be completed early next year.

161
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,503
(TV chattering)

162
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:52,549
(mortar whirring)
(TV chattering)

163
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:12,236
(crickets chirping)
(car engine revving)

164
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,072
(dramatic music)

165
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,258
(car door closes)

166
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,302
(suspenseful music)

167
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,851
Come on, let's go.

168
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,686
I'm tired I wanna check in.

169
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,022
Wait a minute.

170
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,941
(suspenseful music)
I don't like where that car is parked.

171
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,401
There's no law against parking here.

172
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,153
Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

173
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,407
Let's stick around a little while. Huh?

174
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,201
(suspenseful music)
(crickets chirping)

175
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,079
(dramatic music)

176
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,081
The necklace, you've got it?

177
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,541
Not yet

178
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,627
(suspenseful music)

179
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,131
Wait here.

180
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,885
What are you doing? Where are you going?

181
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,011
(suspenseful music)

182
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,472
Philadelphia, a lovesick
boy was wounded fatally today

183
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,475
in a gun battle with 35 policemen.

184
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,604
They trapped him in a woodland
hideout in Fairmont Park

185
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,190
where he had fled after
killing his sweetheart

186
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,400
and three members of her family.

187
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,486
(crickets chirping)

188
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,075
Is this your car?

189
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,245
Yeah, but I sure wish it wasn't Officer.

190
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,455
What are you doing around here?

191
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,874
You know where there's
an all night mechanic?

192
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,334
No.

193
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,752
What's wrong with it?

194
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,045
Stalled on me. Won't start.

195
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,796
Let's see your cards.

196
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,256
Yeah.

197
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,758
(crickets chirping)

198
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,928
I must have walked three miles. Nothing.

199
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,847
Not one gas station opened.

200
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,265
Places close up pretty
early around here.

201
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,683
You know what time it is?

202
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,770
(crickets chirping)

203
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,357
Look, maybe it's the battery.

204
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,108
If it is, I'll give you a push.

205
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,568
No, it isn't the battery.

206
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,278
She turns over all right.

207
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,947
I don't know what it is.

208
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,115
(cricket chirping)

209
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,617
(hood opens)

210
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,703
(crickets chirping)

211
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,960
Okay, let me try it. You got the key?

212
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,171
(crickets chirping)

213
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
(door opens)

214
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,849
(car engine revving)

215
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,743
(car door opens)

216
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,745
(hood closes)
How's the cards?

217
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,455
(door closes)
They're in order.

218
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,708
Some nights a man shouldn't go out.

219
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,419
That all depends on what he's out for.

220
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,795
(crickets chirping)

221
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,380
How many drinks you had?

222
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,507
Not a drop. I never touch it.

223
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,467
(crickets chirping)
No. Let's get a whiff.

224
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,554
(crickets chirping)

225
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,598
Look, what's your line of work?

226
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,350
Instalment business.

227
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,602
-Door to door?
-Yeah.

228
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:33,603
How's business?

229
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,147
Oh, I break even.

230
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,857
You know how it is, it's a struggle.

231
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,774
What ain't?

232
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,860
What you gonna do now?

233
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,321
Climb in the back and go to sleep.

234
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,406
That is, unless you wanna drive me home?

235
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,409
Does that look like a taxi?

236
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,952
Come on, let's get going.

237
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,039
(crickets chirping)

238
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,003
(car door opens)

239
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,880
(car door closes)

240
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:04,968

(car door opens)
(crickets chirping)

244
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,738
(car door closes)
(crickets chirping)

245
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,656
At least one indictment may be returned

246
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,575
by the federal grand jury investigating

247
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,371
the million dollar tax
case of Roger T Lee's.

248
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,706
The grand jury has been
sitting in special session

249
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,334
inquiring into why the
famed industrialists

250
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,921
had been able to evade filing
income taxes for six years.

251
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,757
(motor whirring)

252
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,594
One minute, 26 seconds,

253
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,555
25 seconds, 24 seconds.

254
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,224
-23 seconds.
-What are you timing him for?

255
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,517
You think he can hear you?

256
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,269
(clock ticking)

257
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:01,358
(mortar whirring)
(clock ticking)

258
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,836
Have a nice night and a good
day tomorrow. Good night all.

259
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,092
(footsteps approaching)

260
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,678

261
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:35,016
(suspenseful music)
(footsteps approaching)

262
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,602

263
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,689
(suspenseful music)

264
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,753
(leaves rutting)
(suspenseful music)

265
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,297
Come on.

266
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,094
(throat gargling)

267
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,395
(footsteps thudding)
(throat gargling)

268
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,813

279
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,801
(car doors open)

280

(car door closes)

284
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,480
(dramatic music)

285
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,412
(car engine revving)

286
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,913
(door opens)

287
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,374
(footsteps approaching)

288
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,959
Nat?

289
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,252
How'd it go?

290
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,169
Okay.

291
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,756
(feet running)

292
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,385
Sick?

293
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,511
Nerves.

294
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,846
You don't look so good yourself.

295
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,431
Still racing, it's
going a mile a minute.

296
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,473
You want a drink?

297
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,683
-I'd choke on it.
-Coffee?

298
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,393
Not for me. Nothing for me.

299
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,437
I just wanna sit here, just let me sit.

300
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,230
You Nat?

301
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,025
Nat?

302
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,236
Nat?

303
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,322
I'm talking to you.

304
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,781
You want some coffee?

305
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,451
Yeah.

306
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,953
(soft music)

307
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,184
Wow.

308
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,811
(soft music)

309
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,439
What's it read?

310
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,941
(soft music)

311
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,954
(bright music)

312
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,003
Hey, you're in the light.

313
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,881
(bright music)

314
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,841
Come on, let's have it.

315
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,551
What's the story?

316
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,845
Get out of the light. Move will ya?

317
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,138
How can I see what I'm doing?

318
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,808
(bright music)

319
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,106
(dramatic music)

320
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
It's merchandise, Nat.

321
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,359
(soft music)

322
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,403
It's very expensive merchandise.

323
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,698
-How much?
-We really made a haul.

324
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,574
We got a piece of property here.

325
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,452
All right. All right.

326
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,662
What's the figure?

327
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,584
Oh.

328
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,462
Coming around.

329
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,048
One and a half.

330
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,800
What?

331
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,218
That high?

332
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,387
150,000.

333
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,597
That's the store price.

334
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,391
How much can we get for it?

335
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,936
From a fence,
around 80, 85.

336
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,063
What are you talking about?

337
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,107
That's more than 50% off.

338
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,652
Alright, you sell it,
take it to Tiffany's.

339
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,656
It's worth 150, we sell it for 85 grand.

340
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,866
We'll be giving it away.

341
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,951
You'll be getting 20,000.

342
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,494
That buys a lot of lunches.

343
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,038
You gotta get more than 80.

344
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,749
Here. Feel it.

345
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,335
Watch out.

346
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,504
It'll burn your fingers.

347
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,381
Get that drift?

348
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,049
It's hot dough.

349
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,634
It's scorching hot.

350
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,721
A fence gets a hold of this
right away he's got worries.

351
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,889
Right away, he's gonna start thinking,

352
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,223
how he can get rid of it.

353
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,811
The setting, it's platinum,
it's gotta be melted down.

354
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,190
Stones have to be cut,
recut, maybe cut again.

355
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,441
Not by no second-rater.

356
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,694
A job like this needs a high-grade
engineer, special talent.

357
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,362
You don't buy that with peanuts.

358
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,824
Someday we'll sit down and I'll teach you

359
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,075
the jewellery business.

360
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,204
Better get busy right away.

361
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,955
There's a fence I know in Baltimore.

362
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,582
Call him.
Make it fast.

363
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,334
Sooner we get this thing off our hands.

364
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,379
No. No phone calls, no
wires, no night letters.

365
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,215
Not even in code. Nothing.

366
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,257
Why not?

367
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,094
This trinket needs a market,
we gotta turn it into cash.

368
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,221
Relax.

369
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,680
Cool yourself.

370
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,098
Why the slow motion?

371
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,225
What are we waiting for?

372
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,185
A drop in the temperature.

373
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,853
You think that's hot?

374
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,773
It's hotter out there, boiling hot.

375
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,857
The law, Baylock.

376
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,484
The local authorities, the blue boys.

377
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,945
What do you think they're
doing right now, sleeping?

378
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,781
(dramatic music)

379
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,674
Tell me.

380
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,303
Have you had any visitors, any strangers?

381
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,555
Doorbell, ringers?

382
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,641
What are you getting at?

383
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,892
Did you invite them in?

384
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,519
Show them through the mansion?

385
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,520
Sure I did.

386
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,896
When you live in a place like this,

387
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,398
you want people to see it.

388
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,858
You want 'em to have a look.

389
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,442
One of them had a good look.

390
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,697
- You don't mean-
- Yes I do Madam.

391
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,448
This mansion was cased.

392
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,826
It was thoroughly and efficiently cased.

393
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,162
(train engine revving)

394
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,344
(kettle whistles)

395
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:16,436
You hear it boiling, you turn it off.

396
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,899
(bell dings)

397
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,068
(car engine revving)

398
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,825
He made a mistake so
obvious, I can't understand it.

399
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,787
Fundamental error in criminal technique.

400
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,122
I don't follow.

401
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,415
What did he do?

402
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,251
Let them see his face.

403
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,297
It's almost as if he wants to get caught.

404
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,715
You out of your head?

405
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,052
We can't just sit here with this thing.

406
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,888
When things cool off out
there, we'll be ready to move.

407
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,306
I wanna move it now.

408
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,933
I wanna get my split and take off Nat.

409
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,268
Please. Can't you see it my way?

410
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,394
No.

411
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,771
(hands banging)

412
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,522
You wanna get off that track.

413
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,566
We all gotta move one way.

414
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,068
We're an organisation.

415
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,111
Try to remember that.
-And forget me?

416
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,198
Forget there's a 30 year
rap staring me in the face?

417
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,658
Can't you see my only move?

418
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,493
I gotta take a stroll, Nat.

419
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,536
I got a stroll clear out of this country

420
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,746
and the quicker I get started

421
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,247
the better chance I'll have.

422
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,710
I've always wanted that chance.

423
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,713
Hoped for it.

424
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:26,673
Dreamed about it.

425
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,802
The one juicy haul that
puts the money in my pocket.

426
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,721
The money that takes me
on a long, long trip.

427
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,932
Central America.

428
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,227
(upbeat music)

429
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,812
I'll stay there.

430
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,146
(upbeat music)

431
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,273
I will have what it needs to stay there.

432
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,942
(upbeat music)

433
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,444
20,000 in George Washingtons.

434
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,448
20,000.

435
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,242
(upbeat music)

436
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,744
Enough to buy some ground, grow something.

437
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,372
Bananas.

438
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,456
(upbeat music)

439
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,833
Anything.

440
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,710
(upbeat music)

441
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,920
For years I've had it
up here, the picture.

442
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,258
A lot of pictures.

443
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,759
(upbeat music)

444
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,762
All dealing with transportation.

445
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,390
(upbeat music)

446
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,435
Begins with me at the travel
agency, buying the ticket.

447
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,771
From there I go to the airport.

448
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,314
(upbeat music)

449
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,233
And I'm walking through the gate

450
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,985
(upbeat music)
And there she is.

451
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:30,862
(upbeat music)

452
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,363
Waiting for me.

453
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:36,826
Big, fat, beautiful job with four engines,

454
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,869
80 passengers

455
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,288
and I'm one of them.

456
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,332
(upbeat music)

457
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,127
We taxi across the field, we
get second of the takeoff.

458
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,755
Then we're picking up speed.

459
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,339
Faster and faster.

460
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,176
Next thing I know, I'm going up, up.

461
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,512
I'm up there.

462
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:57,680
I'm off the ground

463
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,433
going up higher, higher.

464
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,728
Heading South,

465
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,397
far South.

466
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,357
Farthest south, you'll
get is South Philadelphia

467
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:11,444
10th and Reed, they call
it Moyamensing Prison.

468
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,489
(suspenseful music)

469
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,121
[Officer] Sorry Captain,

470
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,832
there doesn't seem to be anything here.

471
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,042
Not even close, huh?

472
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,754
George?
-[George] Yeah.

473
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,381
(door opens)

474
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,008
Find more photographs George.

475
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,719
Now bring in those
latest files we received

476
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,472
from Oregon and Arizona,
the ones from the F.B.I too.

477
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,308
(door closes)

478
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,559
What a dump.

479
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,938
$45 a month.

480
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,441
Well, they sure take
advantage of us tourists.

481
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:55,655
Where's Gladden?

482
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,491
In the kitchen.

483
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,494
Yeah, she's in the kitchen.

484
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,579
You know why she's in the kitchen?

485
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,081
So you can't look at her.

486
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,875
You are always looking at her.

487
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,171
What am I supposed to do, look at you?

488
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,422
More on the temples.

489
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,218
Yeah, right there. That's right.

490
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,182
Now the chin. Can you
shorten up on the chin?

491
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,022
Yeah. You know that
lip, that bottom lip,

492
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,399
that ought to be a little thinner.

493
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,483
-You sure?
-Yeah.

494
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,068
Looks good to me.

495
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,696
(phone buzzes)

496
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,157
Yeah?

497
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,536
Well we're giving it a try,
it's the only angle we have.

498
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,332
Yeah, I'll give you a
call as soon as we get it.

499
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,500
If we get it.

500
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,546
(phone clanking)

501
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,090
How's it shaping up?
-It's coming closer.

502
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,774
Nat?

503
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,610
(soft music)

504
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,071
You want a sandwich or something?

505
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,198
Maybe later.

506
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,491
We got some chicken in the ice box.

507
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,410
How about a chicken sandwich on rye bread?

508
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,578
We got rye bread.

509
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,495
Thanks Gladden but I'm not hungry.

510
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,663
Well, you should be.

511
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,832
You didn't have no dinner, you gotta eat.

512
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,210
This'll do for now.

513
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,587
(soft music)

514
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,546
Stop it.

515
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,589
(soft music)

516
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,507
-Stop what?
-You know what?

517
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,843
Don't sit there looking
like you don't know.

518
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,428
All I'm doing is sitting.

519
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,471
Looking at me, looking at me.

520
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,348
You're always looking at me.

521
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,099
So what?

522
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,852
What's wrong with that?

523
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,520
Can't I look if I want to?

524
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:52,813
(dramatic music)

525
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:53,856
-You beast.
-[Nat] Cool it.

526
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,274
I'll scratch your eyes out.

527
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,484
Cool it.

528
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,862
(suspenseful music)

529
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,006
Lay off. Leave her alone.

530
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:32,478
(soft music)
(cards flicking)

531
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,732
(footsteps thudding)

532
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,444
(soft music)

533
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,909
Why don't you grow up?

534
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,078
You stay out of it.

535
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,372
You're over 21, you act like 12.

536
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,335
Wanna do me a favour?

537
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,672
Sure.

538
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,673
Climb into bed.

539
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,760
Go to sleep and don't wake up.

540
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:05,970
(hand tapping)

541
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,013
Why don't you let it drift?

542
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,639
No. I got something to tell her.

543
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,099
You're gonna quit talking to me like that.

544
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,184
I won't have any talk like that.
Next time you open your mouth to me

545
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,352
Then stay out of my face.

546
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,729
Keep your rotten pulse to yourself.

547
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,188
I was only giving you advice,

548
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,523
but you are a stubborn
child, you won't listen.

549
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,191
Listen to you?
I'd rather hear a cat yelling in an alley.

550
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,694
Now move, will you get out this kitchen?

551
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,529
[Baylock] Now you're gonna
hear what I got to say.

552
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,739
[Gladden] I told you to get out.

553
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,865
[Baylock] Put down that
pitcher, you throw that at me

554
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,533
[Gladden] You dried up lizard,
you gonna leave me alone?

555
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,286
[Baylock] All right throw
it. I dare you to throw it.

556
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,829
(pitcher clanking)

557
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,747
Why you.

558
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,960
(Gladden screams)

559
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,587
(utensils clatter)

560
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,923
(train engine revving)

561
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,468
(Gladden screams)

562
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,345
(train engine revving)

563
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,596
Leave me alone.

564
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,431
(Gladden screams)

565
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,934
(train engine revving)

566
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,746
(train honking)

567
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,755
I don't get it.

568
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,716
Tell me one thing, what
do you need her for?

569
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:27,718
All right, she does a job.

570
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,178
She knows how to case a layout.

571
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,430
But you know as well as I do
need she ain't no expert at it.

572
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,308
I know a hundred skirts
can operate better.

573
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,352
So I know that ain't the reason.

574
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,686
(soft music)

575
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,730
Another thing I know for sure...

576
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,276
it ain't as if you got eyes for her.

577
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,404
If you were sweet on the
chick, I could understand it

578
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,321
but you're not.

579
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,073
You hardly even look at her.

580
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,825
You don't even know she's around.

581
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,869
What is it?

582
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,246
(soft music)

583
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,747
Why can't you let her go?

584
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,626
We are an organisation,
she's a charter member.

585
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,838
Now he's calling from the rule book.

586
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,047
Why do you hold onto her?

587
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,465
Why can't you let her go?

588
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,843
(soft music)

589
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,970
There's got be a reason.

590
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,472
(soft music)

591
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,353
(dramatic music)

592
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,898
[Officer] Perfect. That's him all right.

593
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,236
Printing office,

594
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,237
please hurry.

595
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,407
This is Keebler, burglary unit.

596
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,617
Can you send a messenger
up here right away?

597
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,329
I have a pencil drawing
here, a man's face.

598
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,165
I'll need at least a thousand copies.

599
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,791
This is going out to 13 states.

600
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:48,507
(train honking)
(train engine revving)

601
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,317
[Nat] It began a long time ago.

602
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,153
Just another orphan in an orphanage.

603
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,863
You didn't like that high gate,

604
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,657
one day you climbed over, you got away.

605
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,744
(suspenseful music)

606
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,962
They wouldn't stop, they
didn't even look at you,

607
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,215
made you feel lonesome, not wanted.

608
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,092
(suspenseful music)

609
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,720
(car engine revving)

610
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,806
(suspenseful music)

611
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,935
(tyres screech)

612
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,145
[Gerald] Come on, kid. Hope in.

613
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,105
[Nat] And that was the start of it.

614
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,149
That day when he picked you up,

615
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,318
from that day on, you had a home

616
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,238
and a father.

617
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,989
You'll never forget his face.

618
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,784
That's him.

619
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,868
That's Gerald.

620
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,287
And the little girl

621
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,706
that's Gladden.

622
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,835
(suspenseful music)

623
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,838
He put food in your belly.

624
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,800
He put clothes on your back,

625
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,011
a roof over your head.

626
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,179
He was good to you.

627
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,723
He was kind, gentle.

628
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,393
He was so gentle.

629
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,020
(soft music)

630
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,403
You'll never forget his voice.

631
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,488
That soft voice.

632
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,491
You could hardly believe
it when you found out,

633
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,784
when you asked him what
kind of work he did,

634
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,912
and he answered, "I break into places."

635
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:42,955
"And I steal."

636
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:44,999
"I'm a burglar."

637
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,419
(soft music)

638
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,670
But no gun.

639
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,714
He never used a gun, no weapons at all.

640
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,384
That was the first thing he taught you.

641
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,678
You do a job, you do it clean.

642
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,180
(soft music)

643
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,645
And that night, that night
he took you out with him

644
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,397
your first job.

645
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,733
He asked you to make a promise,
to give me him you word,

646
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,276
your word of honour.

647
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,654
If anything ever happened to
him, you'd take care of her.

648
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,739
His little daughter.

649
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,327
You promised, you gave him your word.

650
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,829
(soft music)

651
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,418
Three years later, something went wrong.

652
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,337
It was your fault, it
was your first mistake.

653
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,006
(alarm rings)

654
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,595
(door opens)

655
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,931
(whistle blows)

656
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:43,932
[Officer] Stop.

657
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,517
I'm warning you, I'll shoot.

658
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,477
(alarm rings)

659
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,686
(whistle blows)

660
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:51,065
(gun fires)
(alarm rings)

661
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:51,982
(whistle blows)
(alarm rings)

662
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,401
[Nat] You ran.
You ran like a rabbit.

663
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,527
Gotta get Gladden.

664
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,237
Gladden. Gladden. Gladden.

665
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,155
Gladden.

666
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,413
(door opens)

667
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:23,972
(train honking)
(train engine revving)

668
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,240
Nat?

669
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,908
(soft music)

670
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,035
(wood clanking)

671
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,538
(soft music)

672
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,710
Why aren't you asleep?

673
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,795
I couldn't sleep.

674
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,338
Why not?

675
00:36:56,423 --> 00:37:00,217
I don't know, I just
couldn't close my eyes.

676
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,137
What about you?

677
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,848
(soft music)

678
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,683
-Gladden?
-Yes Nat.

679
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,644
(soft music)

680
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,438
I've been thinking.

681
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,522
What is it?

682
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,442
(soft music)

683
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:17,526
You need a change.

684
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,361
You ought a go away for a while.

685
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,572
(soft music)

686
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,490
Thanks.

687
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,616
Thanks a lot.

688
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,493
Now don't get me wrong.

689
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,953
It's alright Nat,

690
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,205
you want me out of the way,
I'll step out of the way.

691
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,374
Will you quit twisting it around?

692
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,126
All I said was

693
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:34,960
that you needed a-
- Don't Nat.

694
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,921
Don't work on it.
You'll only get yourself in deep.

695
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,549
(soft music)

696
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,467
So Nat.

697
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,094
I'll do anything.

698
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,220
Anything you say.

699
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,557
After all, you're in charge.

700
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,726
You are the babysitter.
Quit that talk.

701
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,770
You're the legal
guardian, the foster father.

702
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,605
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.

703
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,774
Why not? It's what it amounts to.

704
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,276
(soft music)

705
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,488
Unless you'd rather not see it that way.

706
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,448
Please. Will you let me explain.

707
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,116
It isn't necessary.

708
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,201
Listen to me.

709
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,036
It's Dohmer, he won't leave you alone.

710
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,413
And Baylock, you're always
fighting with Baylock.

711
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,416
-I can handle them.
-I don't know, they're getting jittery.

712
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,002
(suspenseful music)

713
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,297
Besides, the trip would be good for you.

714
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,673
You're pale.

715
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,133
It'll be good for your health.

716
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,843
There's nothing wrong with my health.

717
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,345
Now, let's not argue.

718
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,554
I'm not arguing.

719
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,641
(suspenseful music)

720
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,436
This trip I'm taking,

721
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,564
where do you want me to go?

722
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:38,649
It doesn't matter.

723
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,983
New York, Boston.

724
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,860
They ain't exactly health resorts.

725
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,029
You said, I'm going for
my health, remember?

726
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,113
How about the seashore?

727
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,281
Wildwood, Atlantic City

728
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,449
Does it make any difference?

729
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,867
Atlantic City, is that all right?

730
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,536
Yeah, sure, it's all right.

731
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,412
You'll have all that
salt air and sunshine.

732
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,414
You can sit on the beach, go swimming.

733
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,500
Okay. Okay. When do I leave?

734
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,127
There's no use waiting.

735
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,630
(soft music)

736
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,466
Should I start packing now?

737
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,176
Now look, I didn't say that.

738
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,887
You don't have to rush it.
-Don't I?

739
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,974
(suspenseful music)

740
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,689
I'll leave first in the morning.

741
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,735
I'll take you to the station.

742
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,825
(footsteps thudding)

743
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,953
(car engine revving)

744
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,587
[Announcer] Attention.

745
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,088
Will Mrs. Helen Burnat

746
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,466
please report to the
baggage room immediately.

747
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,843
[Announcer] The Atlantic City Express

748
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,929

stairway number eight.

749
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,020
Attention please.

750
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,023
The morning congressional
arriving from New York

751
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,691
on platform number three

752
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,486
will leave for Wilmington,
Baltimore and Washington at 7:25.

753
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,955
The Atlantic City Express will at 7: 15

754
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,291
from stairway number eight.

755
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:27,174
(train engine revving)

756
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,016
(waves whooshing)

757
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,565
(soft music)

758
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,046
(upbeat music)

759
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,306
♪ You are mine ♪

760
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,601

766
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,581
(hand banging)

767
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,499
Nat?

768
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,167
When are we going to do something?

769
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,252
I want to get busy.

770
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,172
Why don't you weave a rug for your head?

771
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,716
(Dohmer laughs)

772
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,884
(hand tapping)

773
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,762
Look, I say we move.

774
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,806
You say we wait, that makes it an issue.

775
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,057
It needs talk.

776
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,767
Alright, let's talk.

777
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,686
Let's kick it around a
bit and see what happens.

778
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,814
It comes to this, if I'm
staying, I kill my nerves.

779
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,357
I gotta get moving, I need travelling.

780
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,026
I need it bad.

781
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,486
Nat, please let me call Baltimore

782
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,863
and make a quick transaction.

783
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,406
We'll get ourselves some finance.

784
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,450
Then we can split the
cash and I can take off.

785
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,409
What for?

786
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,577
You're comfortable here.

787
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,328
If you stay put, you'll stay comfortable.

788
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,497
I don't see it that way.

789
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,708
What I got to do is travel.

790
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,919
And I don't mean no 40 mile bus ride.

791
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,464
A place I got in mind is Central America.

792
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,632
All right. Let it be Central America.

793
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,759
But that comes later.

794
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,595
-It's gotta be now.
-Later Baylock. Later.

795
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,848
Later he says, as if it's
just a matter of killing time.

796
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,601
Look, Nat, I'm on probation.

797
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,478
I can't afford another stretch.

798
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,687
With you it's different.

799
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,272
You've never been nabbed, never booked,

800
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,399
never printed, never mugged.

801
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:50,901
You see the way it is, you
can walk a wide street.

802
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,319
I'm on a tight rope.

803
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,072
(Dohmer laughs)

804
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,452
(soft music)

805
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,214
(water splashing)
(soft music)

806
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,811
(soft music)

807
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,900
My name's Della.

808
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,112
(soft music)

809
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,613
I said my name's Della.

810
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,117
What goes here?

811
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,578
It's a situation.

812
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,996
You do this all the time?

813
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,582
No, of course not.

814
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,709
You know, I've never done it before.

815
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,377
How would I know?

816
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,546
You just know that's all.

817
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,339
You're looking at me and you know.

818
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:42,762
(upbeat music)
(plates clatter)

819
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,603
(glass thuds)

820
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,066
(plate thuds)

821
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,068
(cup thuds)

822
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,904
(cup thuds)

823
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:01,072
(napkin thuds)

824
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,449
(upbeat music)
(crowd chattering)

825
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,408
What's your name?

826
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,827
Nathaniel.

827
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,165
Say, what is this?

828
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,082
What do you want?

829
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:17,422
Basically, basically I'm
out to find myself a man.

830
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,425
(crowd chattering)

831
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,346
Wait for me outside.

832
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,847
Are you kidding?

833
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:26,848
No.

834
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,018
No. Nathaniel, I'm not kidding.

835
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,229
Well, that's tough on you.

836
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,480
Sorry.

837
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,981
(coins jingle)

838
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:35,899
No sale.

839
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,860
(hand slapping)

840
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,153
(upbeat music)

841
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:43,031
Just to let you know,
I'm not selling anything.

842
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,868
(upbeat music)

843
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:47,786
Nathaniel.

844
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,080
Nathaniel.

845
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,332
Nat.

846
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,544
You know, I like the feel of that name.

847
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:57,879
Nat.

848
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:01,174
Soft but it has a snap to it, a soft snap.

849
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,259
(crowd chattering)

850
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,677
It's a patent leather name.

851
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,305
(upbeat music)
(crowd chattering)

852
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,934
Later tonight, I'll be home.

853
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,560
You needn't even ring the bell.

854
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,562
The door will be open.

855
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,941
(soft music)

856
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,994
Light me Nat.

857
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,871
(soft music)

858
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,277
(drink pouring)

859
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,903
That's three.

860
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,280
(drink pouring)
(glass clanking)

861
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,531
Three what?

862
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,742
Three drinks in the last half hour.

863
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,494
(soft music)

864
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,495
Tell me something.

865
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,290
(soft music)

866
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,958
Who hurt you?

867
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,044
(soft music)

868
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,045
Answer me Della.

869
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,672
(soft music)

870
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,924
You sure hauled that in from left field.

871
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,676
Come on, let's have it.

872
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,596
What's the point?

873
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,600
You've heard it before,
it's same sob story.

874
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,270
All right. If you'd rather skip it.

875
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,147
(soft music)

876
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,065
No, Nat.

877
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,317
I'll tell you.

878
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,905
You ask me, so I'll tell you.

879
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,325
(soft music)

880
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,326
It's like this...

881
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,455
the girl comes from a wonderful family.

882
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:57,916
Really wonderful.

883
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:03,088
The old man's a no good loafer.

884
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,425
Mother drinks bootleg whiskey,

885
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:13,848
50 cents a pint, when she can't steal it.

886
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:14,808
Where was this?

887
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,769
Youngstown, Ohio.

888
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,941
Had four brothers, three sisters.

889
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,195
We were a very close family.

890
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:31,991
We had to be close, we lived in two rooms.

891
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,284
When did you pull out?

892
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,037
When I was 17.

893
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,124
I went to Chicago.

894
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,377
Great city, Chicago.

895
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,131
The city of opportunity.

896
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,801
(soft music)

897
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:53,471
First three, I turned down.

898
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,889
(match lights)

899
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,268
And along comes Sir Galahad to the rescue.

900
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,520
(soft music)

901
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,856
Turns out he runs a model agency.

902
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,235
At least that's what he called it.

903
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,863
(soft music)

904
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,784
Best thing I know there's a
bunch of creeps with camera.

905
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,998
Somehow I landed in show business.

906
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,000
I was a dancer.

907
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,920
What's known as a high kicker.

908
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,048
(soft music)

909
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:33,094
One night I kicked a booking
agent right in the mouth,

910
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,389
broke his jaw.

911
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,892
(soft music)

912
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,606
Finally it happened.

913
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,567
I meet an eligible bachelor.

914
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,778
Nice guy, real nice.

915
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,868
So completely different
from all the others.

916
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,163
So clean.

917
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,540
(soft music)

918
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,458
I married him.

919
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,085
And I was happy.

920
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,132
I was so happy, I couldn't believe it.

921
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,259
(soft music)

922
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:17,263
Then comes the left hook,
right between the eyes.

923
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,806
He took off?

924
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,391
Jet propelled.

925
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,726
Why? What did it?

926
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,146
A photograph.

927
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,150
Some joker showed him a photograph of me.

928
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,781
One of the specials from
the modelling agency.

929
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,992
(soft music)

930
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,370
He didn't even bother to hit me.

931
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,872
(soft music)

932
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,297
His name was Gerald.

933
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,716
He had a daughter, Gladden.

934
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,343
Gladden?

935
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,679
That's a strange name for a girl.

936
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,597
Well, she was a strange kid.

937
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,933
Always so quiet,

938
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,186
lonely, bewildered.

939
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,688
Tell me more about Gerald.

940
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,735
He brought me up.

941
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,196
He was a father to me.

942
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,866
He taught me everything I know.

943
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,743
You feel obligated?

944
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,620
It runs deeper than that.

945
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,623
A lot deeper.

946
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,500
(soft music)

947
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,502
One thing he drilled into me.

948
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,214
You make a promise, you gotta keep it.

949
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,510
I gave him my word I'd
always take care of Gladden.

950
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,973
You know, it's sort of weird.

951
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,059
A lot of things come back to me now.

952
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,439
Like the times I wanted to
pull out of that bargain,

953
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,066
get a job, be legitimate.

954
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,735
What stopped you?

955
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,194
I don't know.

956
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,197
I've never been able to figure it out.

957
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,493
Like something inside me, steering me.

958
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,787
Gerald.

959
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,222
Della?

960
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:33,900
Della?

961
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:41,574
Della?

962
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,834
You don't get it from him.

963
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,295
I'll get it from my little blonde doll

964
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,922
down in Atlantic City.

965
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,465
(Charlie laughs)

966
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,593
Better be getting back
there, you have work to do.

967
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,637
You'll get the necklace baby.

968
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,139
Find me some inspiration.

969
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,766
Later.

970
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,559
(crickets chirping)

971
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,353
Let's save that for later.

972
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,439
(suspenseful music)

973
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,451
(crickets chirping)

974
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,040
(suspenseful music)

975
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,587
Competition.

976
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,381
A business rival.

977
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:39,632
I knew this would happen.

978
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,300
This is what we get for waiting around.

979
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,970
We should have gone to Baltimore days ago.

980
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,764
Nat it's still not too late,
we'll go to Baltimore now.

981
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,975
I'll contact that fence.
-No.

982
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,017
What do you mean, no?

983
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,269
We're going to Atlantic City.

984
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,353
For what?

985
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,647
Are you crazy? What do we need her for?

986
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,107
You don't get that point.

987
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,483
She needs us.

988
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:00,820
(car engine revving)

989
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,823
(tyres screeching)

990
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,704

(sirens wailing)

996
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,459
That's for us.

997
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,383

998
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,344

(crickets chirping)

1009
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,744
You know what you were doing?

1010
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,247
The speedometer read 50.

1011
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,748
Yeah, but you were on the left side

1012
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,458
of that white line over there.

1013
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,336
I'm sorry Officer, I guess
I must have been dreaming.

1014
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,797
Well. Don't let it
turn into a nightmare.

1015
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,298
Stay on the right side.

1016
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,466
Thank you Officer, I will.

1022
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,021
Turn off the ignition
and get out of the car.

1023
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,481
Hey Steve.

1024
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:01,983

1025
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,819

(car engine revving)

1028
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,578
I always thought you were
a moron, now I know it.

1029
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:14,662
Why'd you have to shoot in the face?

1030
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,330
Why not the arm, the shoulder?

1031
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,291
Save it. He can't hear you.

1032
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:22,420

Last seen going east on the

1038
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,282

1039
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,118
(sirens wailing)

1040
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,458

1043
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,434
Where we at now?

1044
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,645
Take a whiff.

1045
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,605
(Baylock sniffs)

1046
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,148
(soft music)

1047
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,942
-Salt.
-From the ocean.

1048
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,318
Let's go.
-What about the car?

1049
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,402
We're gonna need it.

1050
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,362
What for?

1051
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,696
So they'll see it again.

1052
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,490
It's number one on their list.

1053
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,866
Come on.

1054
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,702
(dramatic music)

1055
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,923
(car door closes)

1056
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,597
Let's see, where'd that
gun battle take place?

1057
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,392
Black Horse Pike, 31 miles from here.

1058
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,520
That's makes it one mile
this side of Hamilton.

1059
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,397
Here. Right here.

1060
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,567
I guess you know about the trooper?

1061
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,613
They said he got in the
face, died immediately.

1062
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,033
The other trooper emptied
his revolver at them.

1063
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,661
Chased them. Lost them.
Radioed headquarters.

1064
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,706
They got on it right away
and set up roadblocks.

1065
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,834
One here. Here.

1066
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,627
One at this point in this road.

1067
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:27,753
Is that what you guess?

1068
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,964
I'm not guessing. I'm calculating.

1069
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,842
See this tiny intersection right here?

1070
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,678
The trooper passed it and
three miles up the road,

1071
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,472
he came in the first road
block. That's obvious.

1072
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,141
There's only one turn
at this intersection.

1073
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,392
It's a right hand turn.

1074
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,061
There's another turn there.

1075
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:46,731
Another one there.

1076
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,316
No more roads.

1077
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:50,484
That'd put 'em somewhere in the woods.

1078
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:52,611
How could they drive a
car through the woods?

1079
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:55,239
-Wagon paths.
-Very slow, very bumpy.

1080
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,699
Well put yourself in his place.

1081
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,535
You gotta keep moving,
you can't turn back.

1082
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,495
Finally the woods get too thick.

1083
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,080
No more paths.

1084
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,832
So what you do is abandon the car

1085
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:09,712
and walk through the woods
to this point, right here.

1086
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,132
Marshlands the Bay area.

1087
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,843
In the distance you see Atlantic City,

1088
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,762
playground of the world.

1089
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,058
Huge crowd of visitors from
every state in the union.

1090
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,726
Get it?

1091
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,520
This man I'm looking
for is a professional.

1092
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,106
He's extremely intelligent.

1093
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:32,485
He knows that his best hiding
place is in a crowded area.

1094
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,196
An area where he is
surrounded by other faces.

1095
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,032
(birds chirping)

1096
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,789
(water splashing)

1097
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:48,125
(birds chirping)

1098
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,696
(net whooshing)

1099
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,533
(birds chirping)

1100
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,992
(feet shuffling)

1101
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,454
This looks okay.

1102
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:11,125
(footsteps approaching)

1103
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,845
Wait here for me, I'll be back.

1104
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:25,723
Where are you going?

1105
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:26,974
Gladden.

1106
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,896
(footsteps thudding)

1107
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,357
(soft music)

1108
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,196
(phone rings)

1109
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:48,871
Hello.

1110
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,748
I'm calling from downstairs.

1111
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,875
Now look, don't talk, I'll do the talking.

1112
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,918
I've gotta see you.

1113
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,128
Well get rid of him.

1114
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,464
I don't care what you tell
him, just get rid of him,

1115
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,381
it's important.

1116
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,135
And wait there for me, I'll
be up in a few minutes.

1117
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,053
Yes.

1118
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,308
(phone thuds)

1119
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,811
(soft music)

1120
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,735
I think you better go now.

1121
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:26,575
(footsteps thudding)
(suspenseful music)

1122
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,961
(suspenseful music)

1123
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,072
(dramatic music)

1124
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,743
(door opens)

1125
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,412
(door closes)

1126
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,372
Pack your things, you're checking out.

1127
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,540
Why, what's happened?

1128
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,958
Complications.

1129
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,252
Come on. We gotta move.

1130
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,129
Not Me.

1131
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:21,630
(suitcase clanking)

1132
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:22,965
I like it here.

1133
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,050
Plenty of sunshine, all that salt air.

1134
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,178
It's good for my health.

1135
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,472
That's why you sent me here, remember?

1136
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:31,640
For my health.

1137
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,600
What are you getting at?

1138
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,602
I'm feeling very healthy these days.

1139
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,105
His name's Charlie.

1140
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,858
Charlie?

1141
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,443
Yeah, Charlie.

1142
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,361
That's his name, Charlie.

1143
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:45,279
Really?

1144
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,907
Tell me about him.

1145
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,701
He likes me.

1146
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,369
He likes me very much.

1147
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:53,412
Very, very much.

1148
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,372
It's a good thing you are sitting down

1149
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,790
because you are gonna hear something.

1150
01:03:56,875 --> 01:04:00,169
Your boyfriend Charlie, he's a cop.

1151
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,254
He wears a badge, he's a blue boy.

1152
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,591
What are you giving me?
You think I'm stupid of something?

1153
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,426
Get with it will ya? He's a cop.

1154
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,554
That's not all of it.

1155
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,681
He's also in business for himself.

1156
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,059
And what he wants, he wants 100%.

1157
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,643
Here's what he wants.

1158
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,313
(bright music)

1159
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,029
It checks Gladden. It figures.

1160
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,155
What do you mean, it figures?

1161
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,615
How does it figure?

1162
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,076
Downstairs in the lobby, I saw his face.

1163
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:32,993
I remembered him.

1164
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,578
From when? From where?

1165
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,289
The night we pulled the
haul, outside the mansion.

1166
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,917
The two cops who questioned
me, he was one of them.

1167
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,795
Just what are you trying to engineer?

1168
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,755
He's the engineer.

1169
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,383
He pulled a trace job
that wins the grand prize.

1170
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,675
Nat please. Please,

1171
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,427
Don't you see, he had it figured.

1172
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:52,429
He knew I was hitting
that mansion for loot.

1173
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:53,722
Stop it.

1174
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,432
Stop it. Don't try to sell me short.

1175
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,476
He didn't want the other cop to know.

1176
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,105
At the station house, he gets
his own car, he doubles back.

1177
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:04,650
He watches us, gives us a
head start and then follows us.

1178
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,194
Face it Gladden, he's just
a spider weaving a web.

1179
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,821
Trying to pull you in.

1180
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,281
Come on, let's get outta
here. Get your things.

1181
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,576
-I'm not going.
-What?

1182
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,870
I said I'm not going.

1183
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,080
Not with you.

1184
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,707
I'm done mister. I've had it.

1185
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,419
Gladden what is it?

1186
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:24,545
What's the matter?

1187
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:27,214
You don't know.

1188
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,634
You really don't know.

1189
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,637
Well look at me, I'm a woman.

1190
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:36,181
I'm flesh and blood and I got feelings.

1191
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,644
But you never knew that,
you never wanted to know.

1192
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,397
I was starving for you.

1193
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,316
Night after night I tore
pillows apart with my teeth.

1194
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:49,278
So hungry for you, wanting you so much.

1195
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,780
(soft music)

1196
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:57,411
And you, you knew from nothing.

1197
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,497
I was just another gadget in your toolkit.

1198
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,375
(soft music)

1199
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,212
But now it's quitting time.

1200
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,633
I'm out of the organisation.

1201
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,470
(soft music)

1202
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,481
You'll change your mind.

1203
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:26,857
Wanna bet?

1204
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,568
(soft music)

1205
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,822
(bright music)

1206
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:40,787
You'll come back in, we'll be waiting.

1207
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,457
You better stock up on groceries

1208
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,626
'cause you're in for a long wait.

1209
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,170
We're in a wooden shack near the bay.

1210
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:51,089
Four blocks west of the
Albany Avenue Bridge.

1211
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:53,926
You're talking to the wall.

1212
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,595
(soft music)

1213
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,559
(door opens)

1214
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,727
Go on mister.

1215
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,231
Take a walk.

1216
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:09,733
(soft music)

1217
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:31,004
(bright music)

1218
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,885
(dramatic music)

1219
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,533
(birds chirping)

1220
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,660
[Gerald] The only thing
you've got that's worthwhile

1221
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,578
is your word.

1222
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,373
Give me your word, your
word of word honour.

1223
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,294
If anything ever happens to me,

1224
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:12,296
give me your word.

1225
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:16,049
You'll take care of Gladden.

1226
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:17,843
You'll take care of Gladden.

1227
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,803
Gladden Gladden.

1228
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,513
Take care of Gladden.

1229
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:22,431
Gladden.

1230
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,643
(music box plays)

1231
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:29,062
(wings flapping)

1232
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:34,192
(birds chirping)
(crowd chattering)

1233
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,916
What'd you do it for?

1234
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,878
What did you do it for?

1235
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:59,009
She tells him she wants
out of the organisation.

1236
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:00,469
She wants no part of it, she's out,

1237
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,721
She's given us the kiss-off,
so what does he do?

1238
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,973
(pants flickers)
He gives her the emeralds.

1239
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:08,352
He gives her the emeralds.

1240
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,314
(birds chirping)

1241
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:18,570
(phone dials)

1242
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,199
Operator, I'd like to
make a long distance call

1243
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,116
Philadelphia.

1244
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:27,329
Greenwood 3-0-4-5-6.

1245
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:29,790
That's right.

1246
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,671
Look, I need you down here right away.

1247
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,923
Why? What's happened?
Is he there?

1248
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,217
Sure he is here. What do
you think I'm calling you for?

1249
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,760
Can I see him? Can I talk to him again?

1250
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,596
Not for that. I tried that
angle and it didn't work.

1251
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,683
Here on in, we're gonna do it my way.

1252
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,142
That's out.

1253
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:50,310
None of that Charlie.

1254
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:51,812
It's gotta be handled my way.

1255
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,481
If we don't move in now
we're gonna be all loused up.

1256
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,526
Listen, we're playing against time.

1257
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,152
Now get that through your head.

1258
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:02,030
I can't keep running back and
forth between here and Philly

1259
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,740
didn't even report for duty last night.

1260
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,284
I keep making excuses like
that, somebody's gonna catch on.

1261
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,577
Charlie listen to me.

1262
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:08,495
No.

1263
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,873
You listen to me.

1264
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,960
Don't you argue with me.

1265
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,004
Put that classy frame of
yours in that convertible

1266
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,965
and get down here as fast as you can.

1267
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:22,843
Now listen.

1268
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:26,263
They're hiding out in
a small wooden shack.

1269
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,639
I'll tell you where it is.

1270
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:35,647
Come here a minute.

1271
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,943
(footsteps approaching)

1272
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,153
You see them?

1273
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,529
See what?

1274
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,072
Boats.

1275
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,449
So their boats, so what?

1276
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,325
Transportation.

1277
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:49,870
That cabin cruiser.

1278
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:52,581
The white one?

1279
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,333
I'm gonna have a look.

1280
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,127
How do you know about boats?

1281
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,462
They float.

1282
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,964
(soft music)

1283
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:20,877
(men fighting)
(dramatic music)

1284
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:25,257
(hand punching)

1285
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,932
(birds chirping)

1286
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,535
Come on in.

1287
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:56,663
Join the party.

1288
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:00,333
(birds chirping)

1289
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:08,550
Yeah.

1290
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,513
But you don't have to leave.

1291
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,307
I'm gonna give you a real break.

1292
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:19,519
(Charlie chuckles)

1293
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:24,024
All you gotta do is just
hand it over, that's all.

1294
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,734
Alright. That can be arranged.

1295
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:26,943
Yeah, when?

1296
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:28,820
-I'll need a little time.
-No, no, no.

1297
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,030
You don't need time.

1298
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:34,993
You're gonna take it out from
wherever it is right now.

1299
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,537
And you're gonna slide it across to me.

1300
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:38,872
(gun corks)

1301
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,040
Nice and easy.

1302
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,418
I haven't got it, Charlie.

1303
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:45,378
You don't?

1304
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:48,590
What a pity.

1305
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:52,344
What a real pity.

1306
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,513
Turn around.

1307
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,980
Wait, Charlie, don't do it.

1308
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,398
Not yet.
-Why not?

1309
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,610
Why waste time?
-Charlie, listen.

1310
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,654
He's got it. I know he's got it.

1311
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:11,571
Maybe not.

1312
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,406
Want me to make sure?

1313
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,408
All right, go on, frisk him.

1314
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,286
(soft music)

1315
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,554
Tell me something pal.

1316
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:40,266
How old are you?
-35.

1317
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:43,311
You wanna see 36?

1318
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:45,981
46?

1319
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:48,358
56?

1320
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,486
Look Charlie, if I tell you where it is,

1321
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,905
what guarantee do I have that
you won't drill me anyway?

1322
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,448
-All depends.
-Depends on what?

1323
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,784
On information, whether I buy it or not.

1324
01:14:57,868 --> 01:15:00,704
(suspenseful music)

1325
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:03,039
I guess you know I'm not playing.

1326
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,082
(dramatic music)

1327
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,417
-I know that.
-Good.

1328
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,337
We both know if I pull this trigger,

1329
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,173
nobody's gonna call it murder.

1330
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,011
It's gonna be law enforcement.

1331
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,846
You sure dealt yourself a nice hand.

1332
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,264
You save the compliments.

1333
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:21,683
All it is I want is that necklace.

1334
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,144
Cool yourself Charlie, you'll get it.

1335
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,562
Convince me.

1336
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:28,398
(dramatic music)

1337
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,114
Come on. Come on, your time's running out.

1338
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,490
Ocean View Hotel.

1339
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,075
Oh no. No sale.

1340
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,369
She's got it Charlie. It's in that room.

1341
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:42,996
How come I didn't see it?

1342
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,249
I've been putting in a
lot of time with that babe

1343
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,168
and went over every inch of that room

1344
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,754
and it wasn't there.

1345
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,589
It's there now Charlie.

1346
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,051
I put it there for a reason.

1347
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,469
Get his gun.

1348
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,848
(footsteps approaching)

1349
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:04,100
(birds chirping)

1350
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:05,268
Check it for clips.

1351
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,396
Give me the car keys.

1352
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,232
(birds chirping)

1353
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:15,195
Brother here moves an inch, drill him.

1354
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,531
(footsteps thudding)

1355
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:19,908
Might make you famous.

1356
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:23,369
Get a medal from the police department.

1357
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,122
(Charlie chuckles)
(footsteps thudding)

1358
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:29,793
(wind whooshing)
(birds chirping)

1359
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,045
(car door closes)
Nice weather out there.

1360
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,340
Mind if I take a stroll?
-Don't move.

1361
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,428
You don't walk out that
door unless you go with me.

1362
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:43,723
With you?

1363
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,141
All the way.

1364
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:47,227
When Charlie gets back we won't be here.

1365
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,647
Well? What's it gonna be?

1366
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:55,068
A gamble strictly a long shot.

1367
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,361
You better call off that bet.

1368
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,446
I can't. Don't you see how it adds.

1369
01:16:58,531 --> 01:16:59,989
I'm dealing with time.

1370
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,699
I've got to get to Gladden.

1371
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,660
Nat, please don't go for that door.

1372
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:07,455
(suspenseful music)

1373
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,543
Stay away from that door.

1374
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:15,505
(suspenseful music)

1375
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:36,276
(dramatic music)

1376
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,957
Room 42 and hurry.

1377
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,710
(phone rings)

1378
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,299
(soft music)

1379
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,929
(dramatic music)

1380
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:10,018
(car engine revving)
(dramatic music)

1381
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:27,368
(tyres screeching)
(dramatic music)

1382
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,954
(phone rings)

1383
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:37,921
Gladden is that you, are you all right?

1384
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,882
Now listen, you gotta
get out of there fast.

1385
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:44,052
Please if you don't leave now,
you'll never get out alive.

1386
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,556
(car door closes)

1387
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:50,600
We don't have time to talk,
I'll talk to you later.

1388
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,352
I'll meet you on the boardwalk.

1389
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,811
The steel pier, in
front of the steel pier.

1390
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,355
Wait for me there.

1391
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:58,024
(phone clanks)

1392
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,693
(upbeat music)

1393
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,410
(door opens)

1394
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,956
(upbeat music)

1395
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:30,390
(feet running)

1396
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,687
(upbeat music)

1397
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:54,747
Gladden?
-Oh Nat.

1398
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,666
We gotta get off the
boardwalk and back to that bay.

1399
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,459
There's a boat there with...

1400
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,460
What's this you got?

1401
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:00,503
The music box.

1402
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:07,135
(crowd chattering)
(upbeat music)

1403
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:35,538
Officer you wanna hold it a minute?

1404
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:37,582
(upbeat music)

1405
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,752
I'll take over from here on
end, I already put in the call.

1406
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,421
(upbeat music)

1407
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:51,262
(footsteps thudding)

1408
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:59,228
(upbeat music)

1409
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:04,108
We the dead...

1410
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:06,527
welcome you.

1411
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:11,574
We the dead...

1412
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,785
welcome you.

1413
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:20,083
(water splashing)
(upbeat music)

1414
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:23,294
What cop from Philly?
He never checked with me.

1415
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:24,796
(fan spinning)

1416
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,798
Okay, skip it. I'll find out later.

1417
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,674
(fan spinning)

1418
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,176
No, not yet. Don't move in.

1419
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,427
That pier's too crowded.

1420
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,554
I don't want anybody to get hurt.

1421
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,848
(fan spinning)

1422
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,058
(phone thuds)

1423
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:37,975
This is it.

1424
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,936
(feet running)

1425
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,605

(upbeat music)

1428
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,207
We the dead...

1429
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,252
welcome you.

1430
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,045
(ghost laugh)

1431
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,130
We the dead...

1432
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:09,424
welcome you.

1433
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:12,510
We the dead...

1434
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:15,721
welcome you.

1435
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:18,975
We the dead...

1436
01:22:21,395 --> 01:22:22,395
welcome you.

1437
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:25,273
We the dead...

1438
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,568
welcome you.

1439
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:36,284

(audience applauds)

1450
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:47,897
[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

1451
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:51,609

01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,861
the sensational Virengaards.

(audience applauds)

1454
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:57,698
Tired?

1455
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,910
I'm alright.

1456
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:04,705
We'll stay here a while longer
and then work our way back.

1457
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:07,375
(upbeat music)

1458
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,931
I'm worried Nat.

1459
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,766
I don't like it out here.

1460
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,810
Come on, let's move.

1461
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,436

1475
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:06,934

Goodnight.

(upbeat music)

1485
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:39,008
(wind whooshing)

1486
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:42,928
You want it Charlie?

1487
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:46,223
Big joke.

1488
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:49,644
Yeah, I want it.

1489
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:51,479
Buy it.

1490
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,857
(wind whooshing)

1491
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:56,275
What's the price?

1492
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,069
You let her go.

1493
01:25:58,111 --> 01:25:59,695
(wind whooshing)

1494
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:00,821
She can talk?

1495
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,198
She won't talk.

1496
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:03,616
She knows better than that.

1497
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,952
Whatever happens is
her word against yours.

1498
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:09,080
And you are a cop, remember?

1499
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,917
If she opens her mouth,
they'll send her up.

1500
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,753
(wind whooshing)

1501
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:20,257
All right.

1502
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,968
All right, it's a deal.

1503
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:24,637
Please Nat.

1504
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,639
Can't you see what he's gonna do?

1505
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:28,516
As soon as he has it, he'll plug you.

1506
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,142
He'll claim you reached for a gun.

1507
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:32,061
Go on. Do what I'm telling you.

1508
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,604
I'll catch up with you later.

1509
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:38,109
(wind whooshing)

1510
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:50,955
All right pal.

(wind whooshing)

1512
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:54,542
Go on.

1513
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:56,877
You take a walk.

1514
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:00,464
(wind whooshing)

1515
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,969
(suspenseful music)

1516
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:31,495
(feet running)
[Officer] Wait a minute, miss.

1517
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:32,747
Where you coming from?

1518
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,624
(suspenseful music)

1519
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:38,043
(gun fires)

1520
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:41,797
(feet running)

1521
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,719

1522
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:52,224

1523
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:53,517
(Nat falls)

1524
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:56,353
(dramatic music)

1525
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:59,106
(whistle blows)

1526
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:04,111
Nat?
Nat what has he done to you Nat?

1527
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:07,615
(suspenseful music)

1528
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,824
Nice work Charlie.

1529
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:10,743
(suspenseful music)

1530
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:13,829
What did he do, reach for his gun?

1531
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,122
No.

1532
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:18,209
(suspenseful music)

1533
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,337
It wasn't that at all.

1534
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,007
He tried to get away.

1535
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,134
Oh, you rotten liar.

1536
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:30,221
(suspenseful music)

1537
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,724
[Keebler] How's he doing?

1538
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,185
[Officer] He's done.

1539
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:39,188
Well, call the coroner and put it on ice.

1540
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:41,398
(suspenseful music)

1541
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:43,984
He had the necklace on him all right.

1542
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:45,861
What do you mean he had it?

1543
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:50,366
He was afraid of getting
caught with it on him.

1544
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,827
(suspenseful music)

1545
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:53,828
He threw it away in the ocean.

1546
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,121
No he didn't Charlie.

1547
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:57,248
(suspenseful music)

1548
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,874
Tell him to hand it over.

1549
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:01,252
(dramatic music)

1550
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,213

(upbeat music)

1552
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:23,858
(dramatic music)

1553
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:36,328
[Keebler] Take him down to
headquarters, I want them held.

1554
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:39,164
(dramatic music)

1555
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:49,592
(footsteps thudding)
(dramatic music)

1556
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,430
[Officer] What do we mark him Captain?

1557
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:55,681
(car engine revving)

1558
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,182
[Keebler] You mark it victim.

1559
01:29:57,684 --> 01:30:00,769
(car engine revving)

1560
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:07,192
