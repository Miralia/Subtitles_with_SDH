we can have a little talk?

might not be the answer someplace else.

about tractors and seeds.

-Forty percent?

Now where did you get
that kind of information?

to get 40%, sometimes even 50.

there's nothin' I can do about it.

-You got me.

1 00% of the onions and turnips.

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,799
[both chuckle]

333
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,469
Leave it to a woman
to make all the trouble.

334
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,680
Look, why don't you forget
the whole thing?

335
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,266
How are you gonna get booking
for a new outfit like that

336
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,976
without going to Corinne Talbot?

337
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,602
Don't worry. I'll find a way.

338
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,770
Sure.

339
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,023
Corinne's agency has every top hotel
and nightclub tied up for bands

340
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,192
and acts from New York to California.

341
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,696
You won't get anywhere selling
the Comets into some broken-down dive.

342
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,782
In that case, I'll just go to Corinne,
that's all.

343
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,117
Definitely.

344
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,203
You know she won't even let you in
her office unless you agree to marry her.

345
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,039
Oh, she's probably forgotten
all about that by now.

346
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,167
Besides, what's one thing
got to do with the other?

347
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,794
Business is business.

348
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,631
Corny, I’m so sure about
that Haley bunch and that girl.

349
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,968
If I could just get 'em signed
to a contract and promote 'em right,

350
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,678
we got a sensation on our hands.

351
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,888
You want to take it from old Cornball?

352
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,641
With the face and the figure
on that Lisa doll. . . [scoffs]

353
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,643
she's probably been promoted by experts.

354
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,479
Oh, I’m not talking about that kind of--

355
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,150
Hey, maybe I am. Sure.

356
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,861
Sure. Romance, Corny.

357
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,488
That way, I may be able to soften her up
into making the deal.

358
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,324
Hey, now, wait a minute.

359
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,492
These farmers up here have shotguns.

360
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,246
Ugh, get off of it.
She's no farmer's daughter.

361
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,625
You heard her say so yourself.
Her father owns the motel.

362
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,336
In that case,
he probably has two shotguns.

363
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,379
-Eh?
-Eh.

364
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,714
[chuckling] Oh, boy.

365
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,261
Ah.

366
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,013
[breathing deeply]

367
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,556
Get a load of that air.

368
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,807
Take it easy, lad.

369
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,018
What do you wanna do?
Frighten your lungs to death?

370
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,144
[Steve chuckles]

371
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,937
[hinges squeaking]

372
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,817
There's your shotgun bait.

373
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,821
Lisa.

374
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,908
-Good morning.
-[Lisa] Good morning.

375
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,868
You're up and around
kind of early, aren't you?

376
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,245
It's 9:30. Most folks have been up
since 5:00.

377
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,163
5:00?

378
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,999
I told you. It's the air.
Nobody can sleep.

379
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,917
Mr. Hollis,

380
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,627
-this is my friend Holly Jenkins.
-Hi.

381
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,253
-Corny Lasalle.
-Hello, Mr. Lasalle.

382
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,255
-How do you do?
-How about showing me the town?

383
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,383
Oh, I’m sorry.
I was just on my way for a swim.

384
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,968
-Oh, you have a swimming pool?
-You might call it that.

385
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,012
I'd be glad to show you the town.

386
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,473
I'll tell you what, Holly.
You show Corny the town,

387
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,517
-and Lisa will show me the swimming pool.
-Uh--

388
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,976
I'll get my trunks, huh?

389
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,647
Does your friend always do things
on the spur of the moment?

390
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,608
Depends on who's wearin' the spurs.

391
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,694
[Corny and Holly chuckling]

392
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,081
[Lisa] That didn't take long, did it?

393
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,583
No, just long enough.

394
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,962
I was wondering
how you'd look in a bathing suit.

395
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,547
I bet you were.

396
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,092
I must have my imagination overhauled.

397
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,803
You, uh, even look better
than what I had dreamed up.

398
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,054
Thanks.

399
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,392
Smell the strawberries?
They grow wild around here.

400
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,395
-You come here often?
-Often as I can.

401
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,188
That must be what makes them wild.

402
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,524
You don't waste much time.

403
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,069
It's my imagination. It's in a hurry.

404
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,823
Men's imaginations
are always faster than they are.

405
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,533
Oh, what do you mean by that?

406
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,370
You're leading up to the point
when you think you can kiss me.

407
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,330
Oh, well, I don't know about that.

408
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,707
It's all right.

409
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,378
There, it's finished.

410
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,255
Now we can talk about other things.

411
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,884
-Who wants to talk about other things?
-You do.

412
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,553
To you, I’m just a silly, romantic girl

413
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,306
who'll want to give you 40%
when you should have ten.

414
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,224
No, wait. I didn't say anything. . .

415
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,022
Perhaps you won't mind
starting your argument at 30%?

416
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,233
Oh, now, young lady,
if you think you're gonna. . .

417
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,862
Twenty percent?

418
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,739
You're taking advantage.

419
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,658
Isn't that what you wanted to do to me?

420
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,619
And you're also too suspicious.

421
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,124
Ten percent.

422
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,753
Now, look, if you think
I’m a silly, romantic guy

423
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,422
who's gonna take ten percent
when he should have 40. . .

424
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,675
Okay, you said it.
That's where I heard it.

425
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,719
Do you object to the way I do business?

426
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,806
I don't know yet.

427
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,812
[Steve] Twenty percent?

428
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,108
Let's be fair about this. 25.

429
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,573
Then we have a deal?

430
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,952
-Mr. Hollis.
-Steve.

431
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,245
Steve.

432
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,080
You are levelling with us?

433
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:16,376
Honey, managing bands is my business.
If I don't get them work, I don't eat.

434
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,170
All right, it's a deal.

435
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,673
I'll leave for New York
the first thing in the morning.

436
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,759
Now, Corny'll stay here and work out
some more routines with you, hmm?

437
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,719
I think I'm scared.

438
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,639
There's a lot of world
outside of Strawberry Springs.

439
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,516
Ah, don't worry, honey.

440
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:35,019
Why, the public will dig you the most.
ls that the way you say it?

441
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,229
Yeah.

442
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,648
Remember what
Christopher Columbus once said.

443
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,733
"The world is no square."

444
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,444
-[laughing]
-Oh, I’m sorry.

445
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,507
[Lynn] Why, Mr. Hollis.

446
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,594
-Hi, Lynn.
-It's good to see you again.

447
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,680
Nice seeing you.
I hope Miss Talbot feels the same way.

448
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,348
Well, we can find out.

449
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,018
Mr. Hollis to see you.

450
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,394
[Corinne] Send him in.

451
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,938
No earthquake. Go right in.

452
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,608
Said the spider to the fly. Thank you.

453
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,946
[Corinne] Hello, stinker.

454
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,284
You didn't throw it back out,
so I guess it's all right to come in.

455
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,870
-Hi.
-Hi.

456
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,248
-I thought you'd be sore.
-What about?

457
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,334
Men refuse to marry me every day.

458
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,128
Only those in the home for old men.

459
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,421
And you.

460
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,299
Steve, something's been bothering me.

461
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,635
Why did you lead me
to believe you loved me?

462
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,136
Well, let's put it this way.

463
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:54,223
Why did you lead me to believe you loved
all of this more than you could any man?

464
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,726
What's wrong with it? It's made me rich.

465
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,187
I offered you $20,000 a year and a chance,

466
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,147
if you worked out right,
to become a partner.

467
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,899
ls that bad?

468
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,442
No, it's good.

469
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,362
Except that I had my own ideas
on how to become a success.

470
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,780
[Corinne] Or failure.

471
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,281
Yes.

472
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,242
Except that I at least had my choice.

473
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,994
You're stubborn.

474
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,623
You know, Talbot Enterprises
is the biggest agency in show business.

475
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,918
I don't go around offering a deal
like that to every man I meet.

476
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,587
Perhaps you should.

477
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,508
You're a cinch to come up
with something better than old Steve.

478
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,386
-Then why did you come here?
-[Steve] Business.

479
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,470
A favor?

480
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,099
No, I. . . I think I can
make some money for you.

481
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,435
I never discuss business
during business hours.

482
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,396
[chuckling] That's logical.

483
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,649
How about over dinner?
I have to go to the Chez Suzette tonight

484
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,985
to talk to Tony Martinez
about his new booking.

485
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,904
Oh, don't worry about it. It's on me.

486
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,698
A business expense.

487
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,158
Okay, you've got a deal.

488
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,537
I have a new gown that shows off
my vanity in the right places.

489
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,205
I know what you mean.

490
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,916
Don't be too stubborn, Steve.

491
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,460
I'd hate to see you
in the home for old men.

492
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,007
["Cueros" by Tony Martinez
and His Band playing]

493
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,182
[Tony Martinez singing in Spanish]

494
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,506
Well, my pet, I hope
you haven't forgotten your mambo.

495
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,093
No, it's a little bit like swimming.
You throw a man in the water, he'll swim.

496
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,595
He doesn't want to drown, you know?

497
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,598
-I’m not sure I like the comparison.
-[both laugh]

498
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,643
Steve, you're trying to be a crusader
with an unknown band such as the Comets.

499
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,063
Tony Martinez is going to be
the top novelty outfit in the country.

500
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,815
That's why he's doing business.

501
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,484
After he finishes here,
he goes to the West River Club

502
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,570
with The Platters vocal group.
It's a hot group.

503
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,867
Martinez gave the public something new.
That's why they want him.

504
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,369
Now Haley's got something new, too.

505
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,621
Look, Corinne, I. . .

506
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,539
I’m not an amateur
in this business, you know?

507
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,334
I didn't just get off of the bus.
I've been around a little while.

508
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,419
I think I can pick a winner
as well as the next guy.

509
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,588
You've picked a few in your day.

510
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,218
Then why don't you do this?
Book the Haley combo into the right place.

511
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,677
Give 'em a showcase.

512
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,598
And give Lisa Johns and her brother
a chance to demonstrate the dance.

513
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,936
This Lisa's a doll, you know?
Looks great, young, fresh, sparkles.

514
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,354
She can't miss.

515
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,814
Just how old is this doll?

516
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,943
Well, she's 20, 21 . What's the difference?

517
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,237
I’m not sure I know.

518
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,657
Suppose we forget about the dance act
and talk about the band.

519
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,326
But they work together.

520
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,663
Look, it takes a great dance team
to demonstrate rock 'n' roll.

521
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,290
The young folks all over the country
want to see how it's done,

522
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,960
so they can do it, too.
Now, if it's demonstrated right. . .

523
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,379
And if I don't book the band and the act?

524
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,091
Then there's other agents.

525
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,926
You know better.

526
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,388
We'll manage.

527
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,058
Shall we leave now?

528
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,434
Still stubborn.

529
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,187
Let me think overnight
about Mr. Haley and the Comets.

530
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,772
We can decide in the morning, huh?

531
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,363
They're playing our song.

532
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:44,949
I never heard it before.

533
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,411
Then from now on, it'll be our song.

534
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,578
Come on, darling.

535
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,479
-Mike?
-[on intercom] Yeah.

536
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,898
-Will you come in, please?
-Mmm-hmm.

537
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,989
[door closing]

538
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:28,117
That booking for the Mansfield School
for Girls up in Hartford,

539
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,077
-two weeks from today.
-A graduation prom.

540
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,122
Tony Martinez plays the date
before he goes to the West River Club.

541
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,208
We still need an inexpensive band
to alternate with Martinez.

542
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,669
Yeah, something high-class.

543
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,422
This Mansfield School
is the most exclusive in the country.

544
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,466
Calls for a real sweet combo.

545
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,052
You know, heavy on the violins,
light on the brass.

546
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,596
-The booking mean much to us?
-One shot.

547
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,432
Some of these one-nighters
are more nuisance than they're worth.

548
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,685
That's what I was thinking.
I have the alternate band.

549
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,811
Who are they?

550
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,856
A new combination.
They're called Haley's Comets.

551
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,567
Soft music, sweet, refined.

552
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,445
Just the thing for
the dear little girls of Mansfield.

553
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,030
Okay, boss, if you say so.

554
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,324
You know how they'll be received
as well as I do.

555
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,826
I think I know just
how they'll be received.

556
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,540
You know, these, uh, these
lily-white hands are working too hard.

557
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,959
[Corinne] So you'd rather
put 'em in dishwater?

558
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,003
Maybe you'd like playing housewife.

559
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,256
Look, boss, we're in the right business.

560
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,093
We could write beautiful music together.

561
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,304
We could book ourselves
into heaven 52 weeks a year.

562
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,056
[Corinne chuckles]

563
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,392
Such nice words.

564
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,685
Steve could never think
of something like that to say.

565
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,356
-Steve Hollis?
-He's in town.

566
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,986
Well, I suppose I can wait for you
as long as you can wait for him.

567
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,239
I’m changing my campaign.

568
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,990
I’m going to play rough.

569
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,326
-You think that'll get him?
-I don't know.

570
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,870
But I'll know a lot more
when we go to Hartford in two weeks

571
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,664
to hear Haley's Comets.

572
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,721
[horn honking]

573
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,098
[Steve] Lisa!

574
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,892
-Steve.
-Hi, honey.

575
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,436
Oh, Steve.

576
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,895
[laughing]

577
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,943
Hey, you did that like you meant it.

578
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,987
We greet all our guests here like that.

579
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,572
-Stevie-boy.
-Hi, Corn.

580
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,990
-[Jimmy] Hi, Steve.
-Hi, Jimmy.

581
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,200
Well, are we big Broadway stars,
or aren't we?

582
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,036
Well, let's just say that, uh,
you'll be close to Broadway.

583
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,204
How close?

584
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,081
-Hartford, Connecticut.
-Hartford?

585
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,834
Yeah, it's a one-night stand.
It's a high school prom.

586
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,420
-Tony Martinez and the Band will be there.
-No kidding.

587
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,338
I found somethin' else
while you were gone.

588
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,424
Another outfit. With Lisa and Jimmy,
the Comets,

589
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,259
and this new bunch,
we have our own unit.

590
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,595
-What's the act's name?
-Freddie Bell and the Bellboys.

591
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,931
When they don't work nights at the mill,
they come to our Saturday night dances.

592
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,683
-Are they good?
-Oh, yeah.

593
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,019
All right. Now, look,
this is a solid chance.

594
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,063
The top booking agent in the country
will be at Hartford to see you.

595
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,274
The top booking agent. Corinne Talbot.

596
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,276
Yeah, Corinne Talbot.

597
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,653
You sold your soul to the devil.

598
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,822
You sold out for a mess of porridge.

599
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,199
Who's Corinne Talbot?

600
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,243
I told you, porridge. Only, she's no mess.

601
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,537
Ah, Corny's crazy.

602
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,915
Look, this is a great opportunity.

603
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:24,210
This can be the start of everything
for you kids and the band.

604
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,253
Steve, we're in no hurry.

605
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,464
If you don't want to do business
with this woman,

606
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,132
we can find other ways.

607
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,511
That's what I told her. No, it's all set.

608
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,639
Now, we're gonna rehearse
every night until we leave.

609
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,766
-Corny, you tell Haley and the boys.
-Yeah.

610
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,643
Come on.
You can use the phone in the office.

611
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,852
Bully.

612
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,522
You know, when you get there,

613
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,399
Hartford will be closer to Broadway
than ever before.

614
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,195
[slow Latin music playing]

[inaudible]

617
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,652
Steve, I’m worried. This doesn't look
like a rock 'n' roll crowd to me.

618
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,070
You're right.

619
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,614
Still, the Talbot agency should know
what they're doing.

620
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:39,618
I wouldn't trust that Corinne
as far as I could throw Lulu-belle.

621
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,788
Maybe they just want
a contrast in the music, huh?

622
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,915
Man, is it going to be a contrast.

623
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,625
When do we go on?

624
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,044
As soon as Martinez finishes this number.

625
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,421
I'll go get the boys ready.

626
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,525
Senor, if we keep on
playing music like this all night,

627
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,819
we'll have much trouble in staying awake.

628
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:19,533
Just remember what we've been told.
There is to be no exciting music.

629
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,493
Just music.

630
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,204
Si, senor. It's a living.

631
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,054
Why did you wait until tonight
when we get to Hartford

632
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,556
to tell me that Haley's Comets
are a jive outfit?

633
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,059
Those school people
will throw 'em out bodily.

634
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,978
I own Talbot Enterprises, Mike.

635
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,439
I think I'm entitled
to tell you what I please.

636
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,983
This'll make fools out of us.

637
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,777
Just out of Steve Hollis.

638
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,323
You weren't kidding.
You are playing rough.

639
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,868
I want Steve broken,
in pocketbook and in spirit.

640
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,498
You think you'll want a man
who has to crawl to you on his knees?

641
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,750
I'll decide that when the time comes.

642
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,126
I want that band to fail,

643
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,046
and I want that girl to go back
to wherever she came from.

644
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,674
A girl you've never even seen.

645
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,467
I heard Steve talk about her.

646
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,095
It wasn't what he said.
It was the way he said it.

[exhaling]

648
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,059
I wonder if you'd, uh,
go to all of that trouble for me?

649
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,105
You mean, you'd still want me
after what I just said?

650

Well, that's it. The Comets go on next.

-Ah, relax, honey.

in Strawberry Springs, hmm?

Okay, the Comets
will warm 'em up first, huh?

Well, everything looks normal.

00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:54,352
Well, so what's the score?
We've been in New York about two weeks.

841
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,271
We've had about two dozen turndowns,

842
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,690
and we got about two dozen bucks
left to our name.

843
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,276
You put two and two together,
and what do you get?

Too, too depressing.

If I were old enough to believe in fate,
I'd say it was against us.

How do you like that?
Even the radio's singin' the blues.

We spend a fortune getting into it.

In short, we spent our roll
on rock 'n' roll.

Oh, yeah, it's goin' great.

1004
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,287
Yeah, things are really lookin' up
for the kids.

1005
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:19,000
No, no, we haven't set any engagements
after the West River Club. No.

1006
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:22,044
We've been holding out
for the right spot. Yeah.

1007
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,505
Oh, Corinne?

1008
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,508
Yeah, I could get in
to see her this afternoon,

1009
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,511
if it's strictly business.

1010
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:34,390
All right, you tell her
I'll be in this afternoon.

1011
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,641
Okay, Mike.

1012
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,311
How do you like that?
Corinne's after us now.

1013
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:41,063
-[all talking]
-What do we need her for?

1014
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,025
For one thing, Jimmy.
She handles class bookings.

1015
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:46,360
I don't want to see you kids
working in dives.

1016
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,070
Hey, wait a minute.

1017
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,822
Oh, I don't mean here. [chuckles]

1018
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,285
I suppose from now on we won't be
able to afford you guys anymore.

1019
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:57,538
Well, first of all, we don't even
know what Corinne's deal is yet.

1020
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,583
Whatever it is, we'd work for nothing
if you'd ask us, Mr. Freed.

1021
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,294
Thank you, honey.
You kids have all been just great.

1022
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:07,131
And you made more money for this place
than they've ever made in their history.

1023
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,258
Don't forget
to tell Corinne Talbot that.

1024
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,011
She'll hear it so many times,
she'll think it's a broken record.

1025
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,763
Wonderful. Congratulations, everybody.

1026
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,014
Thank you.

1027
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,977
-[piano playing]
-All right,

1028
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,230
so I was wrong about the Comets
and your Lisa Johns.

1029
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,025
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll make you a deal.

1030
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:29,028
Turn your contract
with the unit over to the agency,

1031
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,446
and you come in as a partner.

1032
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,239
Split 50-50 with me on everything.

1033
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,786
Sell my outfit to you,
so you can sell them down the river?

1034
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,288
You'll never get a deal like that
anywhere else.

1035
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,957
Maybe not.

1036
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,292
No, Corinne,
I think your idea of a partnership

1037
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,419
has too many strings attached.

1038
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,921
Then it's no soap?

1039
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,214
No soap.

1040
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,800
What do you want?

1041
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,095
Bookings. The best you've got.

1042
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,641
What if we make a three-year deal
without a partnership

1043
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:01,519
for the Comets, the dance team,
and the Bellboys?

1044
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:04,730
With a good chance
that I'll get them on records.

1045
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:07,817
You're startin' to make a little sense.

1046
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:12,321
I’m prepared to make such a deal
with the unit opening in San Francisco.

1047
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,701
Tell you what I'll do. I'll talk
to the kids, and I'll get back to you.

1048
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:19,954
If they're smart, they'll take it.
It'll guarantee their future.

1049
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,414
Hmm.

1050
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,874
It won't do your future
any harm, either, hmm?

1051
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,669
-See you later, hon.
-Okay.

1052
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,302
Get me Lisa Johns on the phone, please.

1053
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,433
I’m sure you didn't ask me to have lunch
for social reasons, Miss Talbot.

1054
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,226
-Steve told you about the deal.
-Yes.

1055
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:45,604
You know what that three-year contract
could mean to you and the boys?

1056
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:50,276
$1 00,000 the first year, $200,000
the second, and $300,000 the third.

1057
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,319
It seems almost too good to be true.

1058
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,988
There's one thing, however.

1059
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,698
You're an investment, Lisa.

1060
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:59,201
You'll become an idol of the teenagers,
you'll develop a big public,

1061
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,828
hundreds of fan clubs.

1062
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,413
College boys will be voting you

1063
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:06,000
the girl they'd most want to get caught
in a compromising situation with.

1064
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:10,296
My agency will be spending a fortune
on your publicity and exploitation.

1065
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:14,133
The bigger you and the boys become,
the more money we'll all make.

1066
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,302
But you're the only girl with the outfit.

1067
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:20,264
The only one that means S-E-X.
Like a movie star.

1068
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,683
I want my investment protected.

1069
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,351
Of course, I can understand that.

1070
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,562
All right, then. These are the facts.

1071
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,649
If you get married, you won't be
worth a dime to me or yourself.

1072
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,985
The kind of public you're going to get

1073
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,112
won't want to think of you
as a married woman.

1074
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,990
In short, you will have to sign a clause

1075
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,619
that for the life of the contract,
three years, you will not marry.

1076
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:44,747
For the life of the contract,
I’m not to get married.

1077
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,957
-That's what the contract will say?
-Exactly.

1078
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,168
I don't know why you're worried.

1079
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,128
-No one's asked me to marry them.
-He hasn't. . .

1080
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,172
I mean, they haven't?

1081
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,383
Just the same.
You never know when some man

1082
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,970
is going to come out from under a rock
and pop the nasty question at you.

1083
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,307
You'll have to sign that clause,
or the deal is off.

1084
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,601
If I kept all the boys
from making a lot of money

1085
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,436
just because I wanted to be married,

1086
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,356
I'd certainly be a terrible heel,
wouldn't I?

1087
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,317
The heeliest heel that ever was.

1088
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,112
How long will it take
to make up the contracts?

1089
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:19,532
Four days, five, perhaps.
I'll get on them right away.

1090
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,785
All right, Miss Talbot, I'll sign
the contracts. Just the way you want them.

1091
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,538
I knew you were smart.
Then it's all settled.

1092
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,373
You and the boys leave for San Francisco

1093
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,999
-at the end of the week.
-Fine.

1094
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,253
Just one word of advice, Lisa. Have fun.

1095
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,839
You'd be amazed at the number of men
around the country

1096
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,549
who don't want to get married.

you must be taking your vitamins.

1109
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:16,130
Corinne, I came up with an idea
last night that wouldn't let me sleep.

1110
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:17,506
About me, I hope.

1111
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,467
-About money.
-Well, that's second best.

1112
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,511
Now, the returns are in.

1113
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,847
You and I both know
what rock 'n' roll has done.

1114
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,099
It's got people
on their feet again, dancing.

1115
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,351
Druggists are selling
more corn plasters than ever.

1116
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,978
So what's your big idea?

1117
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,771
A rock 'n' roll jamboree.

1118
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,899
Keep goin'.

1119
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,693
Now for weeks, I’ve had other bands
and vocal groups

1120
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,653
making up rock 'n' roll arrangements.

1121
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,989
Now as I see it,
we take a bunch of these good acts,

1122
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,283
put them all together into one big show,

1123
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:47,411
and we'll give them a night of jive
they've never seen before.

1124
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:50,080
Now to get the movement
going coast to coast,

1125
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:54,543
I think I can talk one of the big networks
into televising us on a national hook-up.

1126
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,670
Son, you hit the jackpot.

1127
01:01:56,671 --> 01:02:00,049
Now, look, Los Angeles
should be the right spot for this.

1128
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:04,428
They go for these big jazz concerts,
and I think they'll eat this one up.

1129
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,930
Who do you want to stage it?

1130
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,598
Alan Freed.

1131
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,600
You know, he's handled a lot of big shows.

1132
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:10,893
Sold.

1133
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:14,688
Freed can leave for Los Angeles
immediately and work with my coast office.

1134
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,942
Now the first week in July,
we rent a great big hall.

1135
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,568
All the kids will be out of school

1136
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,613
and I think every kid from six to 96
will go for this in a big way.

1137
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:24,031
July it is.

1138
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,659

1143

and three years
between you and Lisa Johns,

1144
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,421
how about thinking over
that offer I made you?

1145
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,967
My dear young lady,
one jamboree at a time.

1146
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,552

[Steve chuckles]

1166
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:41,692
One minute.

1167
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,069
I suppose you think
I'm seven kinds of a witch

1168
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,988
for the things I did to you.

1169
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,406
Eight kinds.

1170
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:51,577
But considering why you did what you did,
I suppose I should be flattered.

1171
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:52,953
Naturally.

1172
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,038
[chuckles]

1173
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,667
You know, Corinne,
you're not really a bad sort at all

1174
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,712
if you would, uh,
not try to run everyone else's life.

1175
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,380
It's the mother instinct.

1176
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,342
Mothers always do the thinking
for their children.

1177
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,302
That really puts the icing on the cupcake.

1178
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:09,470
No, I mean it.

1179
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,513
Every time the alarm goes off
in the morning,

1180
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,516
I begin to wonder about this idea
of being a career woman.

1181
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,186
Well, you're the boss. Why set the alarm?

1182
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,064
You're being evasive.

1183
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,357
[Steve chuckles]

1184
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,858

before we go into our big finale,

01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,349
I'd like to introduce that living doll,

1299
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:01,478
that real cool rock 'n' rollin' chick
who wants to say a few words,

1300
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:03,813
Lisa Johns and her brother, Jimmy.

1301
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,692
Thank you, rock 'n' rollers.

1302
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,278
I just want to say how thrilled
everybody is backstage

1303
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,322
with the way you've received our show.

1304
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:18,286
And I especially want to thank
our wonderful emcee,

1305
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,664
Alan Freed, who helped us
put the show together.

1306
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,293
And an equally wonderful man

1307
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,046
without whom, there would be
no rock 'n' roll at all,

1308
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,006
my husband, Steve Hollis.

1309
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:37,514
What was that child talking about?
She said "husband."

1310
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,848
She ought to know.

1311
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:40,558
Then you are married?

1312
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:41,893
Legally.

1313
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,770
I have a contract with that girl.

1314
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:46,147
I'll sue you, Steve,
for every cent you have.

1315
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,566
I'll ruin you and her, and that band.

1316
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,944
They'll never make
another appearance on a stage.

1317

with Corinne Talbot.

1318
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,907
Oh, I don't think
you'll sue anyone, Corinne.

1319
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:59,077
If you recall, it took five days
to draw that contract.

1320
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,747
And there's a clause that says
Lisa's not to be married for three years.

1321
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,040
Well, she won't.

1322
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,001
-But you just said that--
-She can't.

1323
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,795

before the contracts were signed.

will be very happy together.
