1
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,207
[narrator]: Once upon a time,

2
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,666
there was a young man
who lived a very exciting life.

3
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,957
The problem was,
it was all in his head.

4
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,624
[singing religious hymn]

5
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:48,541
And when he tried
to put words on it,

6
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,999
it always slipped away.

7
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:57,291
So he began prowling
in the darkness

8
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,832
of other people's lives.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,832
He meant no harm,

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,874
but he was very gentle.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,791
And, of course,
he didn't call it prowling.

12
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:12,666
For him, it was just... knowing.

13
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:55,666
Then one night,
he heard a sad song.

14
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:02,541
It was soft, like the breeze
on his hands and his face.

15
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,041
And he saw...

16
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:07,166
a woman,

17
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,791
walking about a glass house,

18
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,541
singing.

19
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:19,666
"There's a certain slant
of light winter afternoons"

20
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,332
"that oppresses"

21
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,582
"like the heft
of cathedral tombs."

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,166
- She was sort of like a bird.
- She was sort of like, uh...

23
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:46,957
far away in the sky,

24
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,124
kind of... flying, sort of.

25
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:53,207
Sort of flying, kind of flying,
sort of flying.

26
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,124
"When it comes
the landscape glistens."

27
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,457
"Shadows hold their breath."

28
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,291
"When it goes
it's like the distance"

29
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:29,124
"on the look of Death."

30
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,791
"The heavenly hurt it gives us."

31
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:37,207
"Solitude"

32
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:42,666
"a whiteness"

33
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:49,291
"where the meanings are."

34
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:56,249
"A nearness to tremendousness"

35
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,249
[typewriting]

36
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,416
[narrator]: He tried
not to come back.

37
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,916
Night after night.

38
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:51,666
After night.

39
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,249
-Ow...

40
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:16,291
[narrator]: And slowly,
Norman the Gentle

41
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,999
slipped into the darker side
of curiosity.

42
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,999
He was not alone.

43
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,624
[screaming]

44
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,332
- No!

45
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,874
Nooo!

46
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,291
No!

47
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:47,957
No! Noooo!

48
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,332
-God...

49
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,499
Oh, my God...

50
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,791
[screams echoing]

51
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,124
God. I saw a woman
and she's, uh...

52
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,291
Beaumont Street.

53
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,166
And... I didn't do anything.

54
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,291
I didn't do anything.

55
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,791
Almighty Father,
creator of Heaven and Earth,

56
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,457
I beseech thee.

57
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,499
Please forgive me
for I’ve sinned against you.

58
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,041
-A little something
for your writing, son.

59
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:07,124
- Oh, thanks, Dad.
- If you need money, just call.

60
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,374
Jobs don't grow on trees,
Sweetie.

61
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,124
- That's okay, Mother.
- I'll take care of myself.

62
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,416
Bye.

63
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,374
[narrator]: He didn't
tell his parents

64
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,374
what had finally pushed him
out of their perfect blue house

65
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,374
and into life.

66
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,874
And he didn't know
where he was going.

67
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,374
He just set out on his journey

68
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,707
towards honour, action

69
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,041
and, of course, he hoped,

70
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,916
love.

71
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,541
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Would you stop that, you dink?!

72
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:38,957
-Excuse me?

73
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,957
-That's art!

74
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,707
Jesus! You're worse than
the Sanitation Department.

75
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,832
What's happening here,
in fact, is a happening.

76
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,124
Environmental art.

77
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,166
-Of course. I’m so sorry.

78
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,291
-It resonates.

79
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,832
We rape the environment
to make newsprint,

80
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,124
to write stories about
how we rape each other

81
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,374
and how we rape the environment
and now the papers...

82
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,957
God. It resonates.

83
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,124
-It certainly does.

84
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,707
You know where I can buy
a newspaper?

85
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,207
-Which day, today?

86
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,041
Ummm...

87
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,291
I think over here.

88
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,582
Hey, hey listen, you wouldn't
want a job, would you?

89
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,582
Like, I work here for this guy,

90
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,957
but I’m trying to subcontract
the work out.

91
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,749
You see, I’m really quite
a very talented artist.

92
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,124
- Obviously.
- The last guy got knifed.

93
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,416
-No...

94
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,499
-Well, they think
the thief had a knife.

95
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,499
- I’d be interested.
- Good.

96
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,499
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

97
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,499
Sixty percent for me,
forty for you.

98
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,416
You can report for work
tomorrow, okay?

99
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:51,249
- Sure.
- Great. Let's find the paper.

100
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,916
Nice suit. Here it is. There.

101
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,041
What?

102
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,166
Oh, yeah.

103
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:04,457
That. What a bummer.
She was a great,

104
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,457
- great singer.
- Oh, dear God.

105
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:12,374
-"The suspect in custody
has a history of such attacks."

106
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,582
Oooh, she suffered 17 stab
wounds and a broken neck.

107
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,707
Yuck, that's grim.

108
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,832
They don't say where
the stab wounds were.

109
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,874
She was probably dismembered,
you know. They usually are.

110
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,666
Hmm, what a drag.

111
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,166
Hey. Hey, Bud, what's the story
here? You into this job or what?

112
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,791
-Uh, listen, I’ll be back
tomorrow. Now's not a good time.

113
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,707
-What?

114
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,707
[bell tolling]

115
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,124
-She was...

116
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,624
like a horse.

117
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,666
Horse?

118
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:16,291
-Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here together

119
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:20,166
to mourn the passing of one of
the most truly gifted among us.

120
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:25,332
Her untimely death
was the result of a violent,

121
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,041
virulent cancer that is
creeping across the land.

122
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,041
-Did you know her?

123
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,749
-Our only comfort can be the
belief that beauty does not die.

124
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,624
When it is crushed in one,

125
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,457
it is carried forth in another.

126
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,332
Sometimes only
in the gloriousness

127
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,541
of our expression of grief.

128
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,249
But in the case of
the mysterious Madelaine X,

129
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,041
we have the simplicity
and purity of song

130
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:53,166
to celebrate her beauty.

131
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,957
[honking]

132
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:18,957
- Hi.
- Well, look who's here!

133
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,999
Mr. Suit. Huh!

134
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,999
- You going to work?
- Yeah, sure.

135
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,707
- All right, all right.
- Let me show you. Let's see...

136
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,707
Magazines, newspapers,

137
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,957
girlie magazines in the back,
theatre stuff here, movies,

138
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,499
candy, chocolate bars...
Hey! You listening to me?

139
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,499
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay. You got a name?

140
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,499
- Norm.
- As in Norman?

141
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,499
- Just Norm.
- Okay. I’m Zelda.

142
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,999
-Great.

143
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,999
- Okay, make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

144
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,499
-Okay.

145
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,749
[screams echoing]

146
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,457
-No-♩-♩! No-♩-♩!

147
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,166
No-♩-♩-♩!

148
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,832
-Almighty-Ray, that's good,
that's good.

149
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,957
-Yeah, I was thinking about
this story about this guy

150
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,541
- who sees a woman attacked.
- Neat.

151
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,707
- By what?
- Some sicko that followed her.

152
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,207
-And?

153
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,207
-And it could be
sort of powerful.

154
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,832
-And he saves her?

155
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,707
-No, he just stands there,
sort of paralyzed.

156
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,707
And he feels horrible about it.

157
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,832
-Nope, won't work.

158
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,832
Turn right here.

159
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,832
You can't have a wimp
in the middle of a story.

160
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,457
Guys won't identify
and girls won't be attracted.

161
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,832
-He's not a wimp. He's just
really affected by things.

162
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,666
- So what's the point?
- Nothing, really.

163
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,541
Just that the world isn't
a very kind place sometimes.

164
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,041
- Riveting.
- Think so?

165
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,332
-Needs a love interest.

166
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,832
Pull over here.

167
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,832
-You live here?

168
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,457
-Yeah. Come on.

169
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,707
- This is safe here, right?
- Yeah. Come on. It's fine.

170
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,374
-Neato!

171
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,457
- I’m sorry about the mess.
- I'm a bit of a slob.

172
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,499
I bought this book once.

173
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,624
It was called
How To Organize Your Life

174
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,832
and Become Wise and Everything
in Three Easy Steps

175
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,374
but I lost it.

176
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,666
Norm... I want you.

177
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,457
-Zelda, I wasn't
thinking of, uh...

178
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,832
-Of what?

179
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,874
-Of sexual intercourse.

180
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:57,124
-Oh, you're so cute,
I can't stand it.

181
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,832
Okay, no agenda.

182
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,832
I was just, you know,

183
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,332
trying to work out
the sleeping arrangements.

184
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,707
So let's see... Oh, there.

185
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,666
- That's for you, okay?
- Okay.

186
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,541
-So you're a homo, right?

187
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,124
-Umm...

188
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,999
-No, it's okay, I’m cool.

189
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,957
I mean, I figure some people
like vanilla,

190
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,957
- some people like chocolate.
- I’m not a homo, Zelda.

191
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,999
-Oh.

192
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,207
-Sorry.

193
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:40,041
- Um, Norm?
- Hm-hm?

194
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:43,791
-So, uh... what's wrong with me?

195
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,791
-There's nothing wrong with you.

196
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,457
You're very...

197
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,791
you know...

198
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,832
-No.

199
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,707
- Alluring.
- Uh-huh.

200
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,291
-I'm sorry, Zelda.

201
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:06,416
This love stuff
is pretty complicated.

202
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,207
I once had a... liason

203
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,166
with this girl on our street

204
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,291
and it was beautiful
and everything...

205
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,374
But when it was over,

206
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,749
she'd always say something
really dumb, you know? Like...

207
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,749
about her mascara or some...

208
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,707
It was like a tuba coming in
a measure early.

209
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,749
Not that you're like a tuba.

210
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,749
It's just complicated.

211
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,207
-Well, if you want anything
uncomplicated, Norm,

212
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,207
I’m right here.

213
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,249
And I won't be a tuba.

214
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,749
- Okay.

215
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,749
[She imitates a tuba. ]

216
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:09,166
[laughing]

217
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:11,624
-A tuba. That's good.

218
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:21,666
[faint]: No-♩-♩!

219
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:35,416
-Hey, it's okay.

220
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,207
It's all right.

221
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,457
Sshhh. It's okay.

222
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,666
[foghorn]

223
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,666
- Zelda, can I tell you a secret?
- I'm your gal.

224
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:07,707
- I saw Madelaine X once.
- So did I.

225
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,124
On Much Music. She was great.
She was wearing this incred...

226
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:12,124
-No, I mean I saw her
at her home.

227
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:14,582
-Over for tea, were ya?

228
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,832
-I just got lost in the area...

229
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,582
I saw her.

230
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,082
-Come on.

231
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,582
Someone like that would be more
protected than the queen.

232
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,582
-Yeah, well a guy got into
the queen's bedroom once.

233
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,624
Nobody's safe.

234
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,707
I’m not even sure if it was her.

235
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,957
-But you could tell
from a photograph, right?

236
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,749
- It was dark.
- It was far away and it was...

237
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,582
I just saw her sort of moving.

238
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:44,082
- Look it, look it.
- Okay, I got this great idea.

239
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,082
Every station in town's gonna be

240
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,082
collecting footage
on her, right?

241
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,166
Well, I have this very,
very close personal friend

242
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,124
at the station.
It's very close-by.

243
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,957
Hey, Jimmy!

244
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,916
I owe you one.
Love you. Mean it.

245
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:27,374
"The soul selects her own society"

246
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,916
"and then shuts the door."

247
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:36,749
"The soul selects her own society"

248
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,416
"for a nobody"

249
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:41,791
"for a nobody"

250
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:45,207
"till nobody... no more."

251
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,874
-That's her.

252
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,624
-No shit?

253
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,166
-Yeah.

254
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,207
"How dreary to be like somebody."

255
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,999
- There's something wrong, though.
- What?

256
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:06,957
-Well, her lips aren't in sync
with the music sometimes. See?

257
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,957
-Yeah, that's called
singing to playback.

258
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,957
They all do it for videos.

259
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,957
-That's what she was doing
that night that I saw her.

260
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,041
- She was singing to music.
- Like, she was singing

261
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,957
- to recorded music?
- Yeah.

262
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,457
- Her own?
- Yeah.

263
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,874
- 50?

264
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,582
- So her voice was different.
- Huh.

265
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:32,041
"The soul's a lecture
on society for a nobody"

266
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:34,999
"for a nobody"

267
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:39,291
"till nobody... no more."

268
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,957
-Can you ever just go
for a walk?

269
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,457
-No, I'm pretty isolated.

270
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,791
-What is that saying?

271
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:04,957
"If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen."

272
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,332
-Well, I can't.

273
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,832
The whole world's a kitchen.

274
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,291
I'd have to fake my own death.

275
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,166
- Fake my own death.
- You know what?

276
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,249
That is really possible.
She could've faked

277
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,249
- this whole thing...
- Zelda, I don't think so.

278
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,374
- Forget that all
of those clapping hands

279
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,707
have fingernails on them
and that there's a, umm...

280
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:32,749
-Bloodthirstiness?

281
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:36,374
-Well, that's rather
a strong word.

282
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,791
No, no, I think that...

283
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,624
I think that society
has a sense of balance

284
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,041
and that if you respected
one individual for too long

285
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,791
or if you've liked him
for too long

286
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,249
and that balance
gets out of whack

287
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,374
and there is a need
to hate that individual

288
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,374
to a parallel degree.

289
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,874
I mean, alive or dead, we pull
our icons down eventually.

290
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,999
It's a very strange
pattern we have.

291
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:03,832
-Well, it's a very grim outlook.

292
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,332
Umm, could somebody call
that paranoid?

293
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,957
-No, it's not paranoid,

294
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,791
ifs just realistic.
You know, there is a price.

295
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,957
-She sure does know
how to work the press.

296
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,957
-Why are you doing
this interview,

297
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,291
if you're so ambivalent
about public life?

298
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,332
-It's my job.

299
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,832
I mean, I like it.

300
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:28,666
I can't say that I don't
like the attention.

301
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,749
Everybody wants
to be understood.

302
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,416
Well, I'm just observing

303
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:37,207
that the relationship between
the performer and the press

304
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,332
or the performer
and the observer

305
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,332
is like this strange dance

306
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,832
and we're locked
in some kind of embrace.

307
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,832
It's almost a sexual embrace.

308
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,832
And sometimes I love it

309
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,332
and sometimes it absolutely
terrifies me.

310
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,499
[rewinding]

311
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,999
It's almost a sexual embrace.

312
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,041
And sometimes I love it

313
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,749
and sometimes it absolutely
terrifies me.

314
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,957
[man]: Hey, don't push! Hey!

315
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,249
-Thanks.

316
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,791
Oh, Mother...

317
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,207
- Hello, Norman.
- Hello, Mother.

318
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:03,082
-I was just around the corner
and... here you are.

319
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,832
-Here I am. Thanks.

320
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,249
-I won't stay long.

321
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,249
We were just worried about you.

322
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,249
-Oh, Mum, you don't have
to worry about me.

323
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,249
I told you I can take
care of myself.

324
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,249
-I know that, dear.

325
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,957
So, this must be your new...
ensemble.

326
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:29,249
-You forgot your handkerchief.

327
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,041
-Thank you.

328
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,749
-Who's that, dear?

329
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,666
-I don't know. Uh, Mum,

330
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,832
I have got a few things
I’ve gotta go do.

331
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,249
Uh, thanks for the cookies.
They look great.

332
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,249
Uh, tell Dad I’ll give
you guys a call

333
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,249
later on in the week, okay?

334
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,374
Zelda, could you take care
of the news stand for me

335
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,291
- for a little while?
- Oh, okay.

336
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:53,624
[neighing]

337
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,624
-Oh!

338
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,666
-What are you doing here?

339
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:35,416
You followed me.

340
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:38,999
-Yes, I did.

341
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,707
-What do you want?

342
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,582
-To know if you need
any gardening work done?

343
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:58,249
-Do you always follow
people to their homes

344
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,749
to ask them if they need
gardening work?

345
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:06,332
-Rarely. I’m sorry. I...

346
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,874
I thought that...
I don't know what I thou...

347
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,624
I was afraid
I wouldn't see you again.

348
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,582
-Do you like me?

349
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,374
-Yes. Well, I mean...

350
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:30,916
It's hard to say.
I don't even know you.

351
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:32,832
Umm...

352
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,291
but I do think your lawn
could use a trim.

353
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:48,166
There's always
the Japanese maple.

354
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,166
Which has the attractive bonus
of fall color.

355
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:08,416
Or there's the... the "podcar".

356
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:11,374
Uh... "podpus".

357
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,791
"Podpus". Which makes
a lovely, lacy screen

358
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:16,832
when planted in rows.

359
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:21,874
-Do you plan to take out trees?

360
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,374
-Oh, I don't think removal
is the answer.

361
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,207
Well, first of all, did you know
that the root system

362
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:30,207
of most trees has as much volume

363
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,624
as the exterior branch system?

364
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,832
Interesting, eh?

365
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:41,791
So, consequently,
I think that removal is, uh...

366
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,291
too radical.

367
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:46,624
- It's all in the shaping.
- In the shaping.

368
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,291
-So what I was thinking was that
I’d just start on it and, uh...

369
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:55,332
keep on going until
we decide to stop.

370
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,332
And then stop.

371
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,291
Uh, this means, of course,
that I'll have

372
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,874
to consult with you
on a regular basis.

373
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,207
I don't know if you plan
to be around, or...

374
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,707
-Oh. Yes, I'll be around.

375
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,332
-Well, then, there you go.

376
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,666
Uh, my name is Norm.

377
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,957
-Thanks, Norm.

378
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,082
- Hm-mm.
- Hi.

379
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:49,957
- Huh!!
- Oh, I am sorry. I am so sorry.

380
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:53,124
-Don't you do that.

381
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:54,666
-I...

382
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,166
I was just gonna ask you
about the, uh, the back.

383
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,707
-Don't.

384
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,832
-Okay, fine, fine.

385
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:08,166
-I don't think this gardening
thing is such a good idea.

386
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:10,082
-Oh, no, I think
you're very mistaken.

387
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,166
I was just about to ask you
about trimming this hedge,

388
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:15,957
but we could, uh, make it,
uh, undulating, sort of.

389
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,749
-Undulating?

390
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,416
- Yeah, you know, like waves.
- Could be great, couldn't it?

391
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:25,624
- Can you do me a favour?
- Sure.

392
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:29,166
-Can you make sure that no one
comes onto this property?

393
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:30,791
- Okay.

394
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,957
Are you worried about something?

395
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:36,499
-Yes, this hedge.

396
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:40,624
How would we make it undulate?

397
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:43,499
Doesn't sound very practical.

398
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,832
-Beautiful things
aren't practical.

399
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,624
- Ah, Belinda!
- [cowbell]

400
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:05,666
Hey, Belinda!

401
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,541
-I mean, it just makes
more sense

402
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,666
for me to kind of
camp out there.

403
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,041
Sure you don't mind, eh?

404
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,249
-No, no, that's fine. It's cool.

405
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:17,832
By the way, how's the
Madelaine X story coming?

406
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,749
I got your number, Buddy.
You're doing the story

407
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,374
and you're freezing me out,
aren't ya?

408
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,499
-You're imagining things.

409
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,582
-What about that woman?

410
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:30,082
The one who looks like a horse?

411
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,082
How does she tie in?

412
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,999
-You looked at my stuff.

413
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,666
I don't think that's
very respectful, Zelda.

414
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:39,916
-That's rich. Respectful?

415
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,207
-Look, I’m sorry
about the news stand job.

416
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,166
It's just not my cup of tea.

417
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,207
But I’ll...

418
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,332
you know, I'll visit.

419
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,082
Oh, by the way,

420
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,124
where's my little tape recorder?

421
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,124
- What recorder?
- Zelda!

422
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,082
-Oh, yeah. It's, um...

423
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,082
It's at the news stand.

424
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:13,666
-I’ll be back for it. Nice try!

425
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,999
Aren't you hot, Ma'am?

426
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:00,999
-Jane.

427
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,999
[murmuring ]: I can't believe

428
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,332
how long it's been
since I’ve said that.

429
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:10,999
Yes, it must be at least
30 degrees out here.

430
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,457
-Excuse me for asking,

431
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:20,457
but why don't you put on
some cooler clothes?

432
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,999
-I don't have any.

433
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:27,999
-Yeah, well, it's dangerous
to overheat yourself, you know.

434
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,999
You could make some.

435
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:36,166
-I’m not a big sewer, Norm.

436
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,999
-Well, here, I have an idea.

437
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:45,624
Come on. It's okay. Come on.

438
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,499
[giggling]

439
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,291
[giggling]

440
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,041
[giggling]

441
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,416
- Hi there!
- [cowbell]

442
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,999
-Uh, excuse me,
what are you doing here?

443
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,291
-Name's John Waters
from down the road here.

444
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:34,999
This here is Belinda.

445
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:38,957
She's just finished running away
for the third time this week.

446
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:43,707
So, on the way back, I just
noticed your lane way here,

447
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:46,332
and I figured...

448
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:50,082
well, why not see if they'd like

449
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:52,082
to try and keep her happy.

450
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:54,499
She don't want to live
with me no more.

451
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,874
- [mooing]
- Hello there, Madam.

452
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,999
-Hello.

453
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:03,332
-He says he wants
to sell the cow.

454
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,332
Listen, Sir, I don't think
we need a cow here

455
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,332
and so I think you should just...

456
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,749
-Oh, my goodness, Norman,
no need to be rude.

457
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,332
- I'm not being rude.
- I just think that...

458
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:17,207
uninvited guests... Remember?

459
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,874
-I don't think he's a threat,
Norm.

460
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,207
So you'd like

461
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,207
to sell us this cow?

462
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,916
- Oh, yes, Ma'am.
- She's a great milker.

463
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:29,791
Especially when I sing to her.

464
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:32,082
-You sing to her?

465
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:36,457
-Oh yeah. She really likes
the cow-cow boogie.

466
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:40,166
She likes that cow song.

467
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:43,666
"Bessie moo-moo cow"

468
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:45,791
[laughing]

469
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:47,957
She's a good milker.

470
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:52,124
.Are you getting any?

471
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,874
-No. You?

472
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,999
-No.

473
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,832
He said she likes music.
What do you think?

474
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:09,291
-Why not?

475
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:38,082
"There's a certain slant
of light winter afternoons."

476
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:46,291
"That oppresses like
the heft of cathedral tombs."

477
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,791
"When it comes
the landscape glistens."

478
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:14,541
"Shadows hold their breath."

479
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,791
"When it goes it's
like the distance"

480
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:24,207
"on the look of Death."

481
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:28,957
"The heavenly hurt
it gives us..."

482
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:31,791
-Norm?

483
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,957
"Solitude a whiteness."

484
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:39,374
"And an ache where"

485
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,374
"the meanings are."

486
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:51,499
"A nearness to tremendousness."

487
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,499
-Okay. So I’ll be
leaving now, Jane.

488
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,666
-Oh, okay.

489
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,707
- Bye, Norm.
- Bye.

490
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,749
Excuse me for asking, but, uh...

491
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:29,666
aren't you ever afraid
of being alone here at night?

492
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:32,374
-Why?

493
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,624
-It's just that the world isn't
a very kind place sometimes.

494
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,291
-You've noticed that too,
have you?

495
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:44,541
-Yeah. Well, I had some...

496
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:47,624
problems with my parents
when I was young.

497
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,874
-Like what?

498
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,124
-Uh...

499
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:56,124
Well, they beat me.

500
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:59,082
You know, cigarettes, all that.

501
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:04,332
-They beat you with cigarettes?

502
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:07,666
-Never mind. Forget it.

503
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:13,291
-Your mother didn't
look the son.

504
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:17,291
-How do you know?

505
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:19,332
-In the park, remember?

506
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,999
She was checking up on you.

507
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,624
Bearing love and cookies.

508
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,957
- Were you watching me?
- Yes.

509
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:35,832
And I had to get away
from this place.

510
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,499
I needed some company.

511
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:47,499
-Yeah, but you must know
other people.

512
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:51,124
-No, not really.

513
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:55,374
I’m not good at it.

514
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,666
-Why me?

515
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:03,291
-I don't know why I'm attracted
to helpless people.

516
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,207
They move me.

517
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:13,332
Do you have someone
who loves you?

518
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:11,332
It's okay.

519
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,166
[flipping radio stations]

520
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:14,916
[announcer]: Madeleine X's
murderer has been arrested

521
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:17,916
and is awaiting trial.
But this story isn't over yet.

522
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:21,124
It seems that no one has ever
heard Madelaine sing live.

523
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:23,499
Not only did she lipsync
all her concerts,

524
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:25,916
but it now appears she always
brought in the voice tracks

525
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,999
for her albums already recorded.

526
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,916
So somebody out there has
a great voice and isn't telling.

527
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:32,916
Well, whoever she is,

528
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,916
here she is at number four
on the Hot 1 00.

529
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:36,916
Hello I’m Nobody.

530
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:41,624
"Hello I am nobody."

531
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,916
"Who are you."

532
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:48,332
"Oh I am nobody"

533
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,416
"the two of us..."

534
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:15,041
[She's humming
Hello I’m Nobody.]

535
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:47,041
[narrator]:
Norman came to believe

536
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:49,291
that she was the real singer,

537
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:51,791
and she had found him
to protect her.

538
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:54,582
He swore that he would.

539
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:51,124
-She, she, she...

540
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:54,207
Argh! God.

541
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:57,041
[narrator]:
But still no words,

542
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:59,041
and no one to listen.

543
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:01,999
Until one day...

544
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:14,166
-Okay, I'm gonna act on a need.

545
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,291
-You don't care if it's
a mutual need?

546
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,957
-I'm sorry. Of course I do.

547
00:56:39,292 --> 00:56:41,207
-Well it is.

548
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:47,791
-Shoot!

549
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,999
[sighing]

550
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:42,541
-Hey, Buck.

551
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:44,541
What the hell brings you back?!

552
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:46,999
-Actually, paper.

553
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:49,124
I finally wrote something.

554
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:53,624
-What, how to put
zip in your 'zaleas?

555
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,957
-No, actually, it's sort
of like a love story.

556
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:00,457
- Oh!
- Careful.

557
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:04,374
-Must be about that horse woman
with the stupid hat, huh?

558
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,416
-Yeah, her.

559
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,582
-Uh, I guess she makes you
"melt inside your skin." Huh.

560
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:16,166
"Makes your spine turn
to rubber." Oooh, Normie.

561
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:18,332
- Good, huh?
- Huh.

562
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,666
"Then I thought she was
the real singer."

563
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:25,374
The voice behind Madelaine X?
Holy shit, Norm!

564
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,374
- No, no, no, no.
- Was that her?

565
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,624
- Forget it. Keep your pants on.
- I was wrong.

566
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,374
She can't sing to save her life.

567
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,374
- How do you know?
- Maybe she was fooling you.

568
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,374
- She wouldn't fool me.
- I can't believe this.

569
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,374
This is great, Norm.
You found her.

570
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,374
- Give it back, Zelda.
- What?

571
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,416
- Give it back.
- No.

572
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:45,541
-Give it back!

573
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:47,791
Zelda! Zelda!!

574
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,374
-Ha-ha!

575
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,707
-Zelda!

576
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,082
-Ha-ha!

577
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,166
- Give me... back. Uh.
- Ha-ha-ha!

578
01:02:11,917 --> 01:02:14,374
Norman.

579
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,374
- God. Give it to me.
- Give it back!

580
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,499
-Don't deny how I’ve suffered
because of you.

581
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:23,624
- I don't believe this.
- Will you give it back?!

582
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:26,291
So you're a reporter now.
ls that the career of the week?

583
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,499
You make me fucking crazy!!

584
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:33,166
You're like this grasping
demento running around

585
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,666
with a ladder, planting
it in the ground and...

586
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:38,291
and climbing up in the ozone
and falling flat on your face!

587
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:41,332
Where you climbing to, Zelda?
Huh? You don't know.

588
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,666
You just want up, right?
You got any skills, Zelda?

589
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:48,832
You gonna work to get any, huh?
Oh, no, no, no! Work, no! Blah!

590
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,499
Oh, that's terrible.
You don't work, do ya?

591
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,291
It's all about having the right
connections, isn't it?

592
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:57,291
It's all about where you plant
your fucking ladder!

593
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:00,207
[applause]

594
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,166
Oh, great.

595
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:07,207
- Hey, they liked it, Normie.
- Give 'em some more.

596
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:10,874
They like that, uh... you know,
that masterful shtick.

597
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,249
- It's you they like, Zelda.
- Go on, do something.

598
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,749
- What?
- Yeah.

599
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:19,582
-Oh. All right.

600
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,457
Hey! Jerk.

601
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,832
- Jeez, I hope she likes this.
- Of course she's gonna love it.

602
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,041
She's gonna love it.
I wrote it, she’ll love it.

603
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,041
I wrote it, I wrote!

604
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:40,541
I can't believe I wrote
something. Oh, God.

605
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:53,457
[knocking]

606
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,874
[mounting footsteps]

607
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:18,666
-We were all shocked
and devastated

608
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,666
by what happened to Maddie.

609
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:22,666
It's gonna be difficult,

610
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,666
but we'll have
to make the best of it.

611
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,791
-How do you make
the best of death?

612
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:29,707
-Well, you know what we mean.

613
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:35,666
-Who told the press?

614
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,707
-My ex.

615
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:45,166
-Jane, they'll be
all over us like flies.

616
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:47,624
We won't be able to breathe.

617
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,957
They're riding everyone
at the record company:

618
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:54,166
The musicians,

619
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,707
Maddie's cleaning staff.

620
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:59,874
-Nobody knows anything.

621
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,874
Now listen.

622
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,624
I write a couple more songs.

623
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,124
You try to imitate
Maddie's mixes.

624
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,791
You call it a previously
unreleased album

625
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:12,957
- and that's it, the story's over.
- No.

626
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:16,957
But we will protect you.

627
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:19,124
We'll put in
a surveillance system.

628
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,124
Jane, with one interview,

629
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,499
one live appearance
and a few photos

630
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:29,791
and then we can do
all of the rest.

631
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:34,041
Then, we can go on
recording for years.

632
01:05:34,167 --> 01:05:37,166
Come on. The press
loves this stuff.

633
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,124
-Liz...

634
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:44,457
-I’ve never asked for very much.

635
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,457
-Jane, you can have
as much money as you need.

636
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:49,582
I mean, we did buy you
this house.

637
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,791
- She bought it.
- It wouldn't have occurred to you.

638
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:53,332
[laughing]

639
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,832
You know,

640
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:59,457
we can't be sure that
they won't discover you anyway.

641
01:06:03,917 --> 01:06:06,291
-I wish it'd been me
instead of Maddie.

642
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:09,541
- Please don't talk like that.
- Please don't talk like that?

643
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:11,541
-Jane. Jane!

644
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,041
- Jane, Jane, Jane...
- She's playing with us.

645
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:16,541
-She's getting
all psychotic again.

646
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:18,666
Jane, relax. Please, Jane.

647
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,707
-Relax, please?

648
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:24,832
Can't let the golden egg
crack, can we?

649
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,457
- Jane, stop this game.
- She'll be fine.

650
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:30,749
-She'll be fine. Just give her
a taste of life in limos.

651
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,749
She'll be fine.
She's got no way out.

652
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,791
-Jane, please don't do this.

653
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:39,624
-Anybody who dares to act
this crazy must be crazy.

654
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:41,291
-What?

655
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:44,082
Jane, who the hell is that?

656
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,041
-Excuse me,

657
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:52,791
but I think that you two
should leave. Because, uh...

658
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:55,666
Because I think you should.

659
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:59,499
-Powerful argument.

660
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,499
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Norm.

661
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:05,999
And I have been charged
with the duty

662
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:08,499
of making sure
that unwanted guests

663
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:11,832
are kept off this property.

664
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,957
So, if you please...

665
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:16,707
- Okay.

666
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:22,499
I guess I'll just have
to come back again.

667
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:23,624
-Mm-hm.

668
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,791
-And I will come back, Jane.

669
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,999
-Please.

670
01:07:30,917 --> 01:07:32,999
-Ha! Ha! Ha!

671
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:36,166
-You okay? What did they want?

672
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:38,999
-Money wants me to talk.

673
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:44,957
I just can't think...

674
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,541
-It's okay, it's all right.

675
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:51,124
I made something for you.

676
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:52,999
-You're too nice to me.

677
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:55,999
- Yeah, well it...
- When I was little,

678
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:59,332
I went to visit a canary farm,
just to watch them.

679
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,499
Hundreds of canaries
in big cages,

680
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:04,416
and I could hear
that one of them

681
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,916
had an incredibly clear voice
and so,

682
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:09,416
for a long time I stood there,

683
01:08:09,542 --> 01:08:12,332
trying to find which one it was
and then finally I saw him.

684
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,666
He was this scraggly, pathetic,

685
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,874
little grey thing
with no feathers,

686
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,916
singing his little heart out.

687
01:08:21,042 --> 01:08:24,124
Later, the owner told me
that the other canaries al...

688
01:08:24,292 --> 01:08:29,499
always peck at the one
with the purest voice.

689
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:35,374
-Maybe it had the purest voice
because they pecked at it.

690
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,457
-Maybe.

691
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:50,249
"Have you seen the ghost of Tom."

692
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:56,249
"Long white bones
with the skin all gone."

693
01:08:56,375 --> 01:09:00,916
"Pooor... Tom."

694
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:06,291
"Wouldn't it be chilly
with no skin on."

695
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:15,166
You know, don't you?

696
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:17,541
-Yeah.

697
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,499
-Hi, kids.

698
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,874
-What are you doing here?

699
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,499
- I, uh...
- Go away.

700
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:50,166
-I followed you here. I was
curious to see what was so...

701
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:52,166
alluring.

702
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,457
-How did... Zelda, go away!

703
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,041
She works at the news stand.

704
01:09:56,167 --> 01:09:57,999
Don't worry,
she doesn't know any...

705
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:00,707
-Huh. So I see this has
become quite an in-depth

706
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,457
little story here, Normie.

707
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:06,957
-Norm?

708
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,332
-She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

709
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,332
I just found out...

710
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,332
-You do realize that
this young man has written

711
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:17,207
quite an intensive article
on you? Right?

712
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:19,374
-It's not an article.

713
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:24,332
Jane. Jane, listen,
it's not an article.

714
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,166
-Huh. You know,
you have a really...

715
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,957
You have a lovely voice, Jane.

716
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:33,124
You ought to do something
with that.

717
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:35,166
- Kill you!
- I promise I'll kill you!

718
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:37,332
-You know what? I'm a singer
too. I have this...

719
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,332
-Do you realize
what you've done?

720
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,332
-I have an idea, yes.

721
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,874
-Whatever possessed you
to barge in like that?

722
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,832
You don't realize how long it
has taken me to gain her trust.

723
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:53,374
You've been kicked around so
much, you don't even understand

724
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,832
- how fragile some people can be.
- Oh, fragile-smagile.

725
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,416
Listen, listen, you got a juicy
story and I want in on it.

726
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:03,791
Just relax. I can help you
with the woman's angle, okay?

727
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:05,791
Okay, now look it, look it,
I can help you.

728
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:08,166
Let's just trot right
in there, right this second,

729
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:11,291
and get the exclusive. Do you
have any idea what that's worth?

730
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:12,832
-Well.

731
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:17,291
Well, I don't know.
I don't think she's gonna talk

732
01:11:17,417 --> 01:11:19,791
in front of somebody else.
I really don't.

733
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,291
- Come on.
- The woman has been living alone

734
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:25,457
for 15 years. She's not about to
start throwing dinner parties.

735
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:28,291
-Oh. Okay, listen, listen.

736
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:31,166
I’ll see you back at the stand
in an hour and a half, okay?

737
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:33,999
But listen, if I don't see you
there, I got this, uh...

738
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,207
this little hit single here

739
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,791
that I’m sure quite a few people
would be interested in.

740
01:11:38,917 --> 01:11:40,791
- Just one?
- One what?

741
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:43,291
- You've just got one song?
- Yeah.

742
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:45,291
-Oh, Jesus, Zelda,
where the hell were you?

743
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:48,291
There was some
great stuff earlier on.

744
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:50,291
Well, at least
it's sort of clear.

745
01:11:50,417 --> 01:11:51,791
-Huh?

746
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:54,957
-I better get back to her. She's
nice and exposed right now.

747
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:03,707
-If you're scamming me,
you just remember

748
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:06,707
you got an hour and a half to
get back to the stand. Okay?

749
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:08,707
If you're not there,

750
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:11,207
this place is gonna be swarming
with fans real fast.

751
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:13,207
-Don't worry, Zelda.

752
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:16,707
-By the way, listen, I, umm...

753
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,207
I thought you loved her.

754
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,707
-Her? You gotta be kidding.

755
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:24,207
All that stuff I was writing,

756
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:26,707
I wrote that to pry her open
a little bit.

757
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:29,541
They thrive on compliments.
You know.

758
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:32,666
-God.

759
01:12:32,792 --> 01:12:35,249
- I underestimated you.
- Yeah.

760
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,249
Go.

761
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,207
Look, Jane,
you don't understand.

762
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:01,249
-No, I don't. Feels like a
pretty cliché, story to me, Norm.

763
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:04,457
She thinks it's love,
but it's only ambition.

764
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:06,791
Oh, it's been done, baby,
it's been done.

765
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:09,332
- Look at me. Look at me.
- We could run away together.

766
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:11,207
I’m not a reporter,
I'm not a writer,

767
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:13,207
I’ve never, ever
written anything.

768
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:15,416
I only heard all
that stuff today

769
01:13:15,542 --> 01:13:17,666
when those people came here.
I just...

770
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:20,999
I just love you. I love you
more than I can tell.

771
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:24,374
That's what I wrote. Listen.

772
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:28,332
Here. Read it, please. Read it.
That's what I wrote.

773
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:32,666
Jane, please. Please. Please.

774
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:40,166
Please.

775
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:42,082
Please.

776
01:13:59,292 --> 01:14:01,291
You don't understand.

777
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:06,624
"Wouldn't it be chilly
with no skin on."

778
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:10,582
-No, I don't.

779
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,582
-I just, I just...

780
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:14,582
Zelda did that. She... she...

781
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:16,707
- It's my recorder, but...
- Do you wanna know things?

782
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:19,082
- I left it at her house and...
- ls that what you want?

783
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,874
You wanna know things?

784
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,499
- Come with me.
- She recorded it. I got it ba...

785
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:26,082
- No, come on with me.
- Jane, I would never hurt you.

786
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,499
-You're gonna like this, Norm.

787
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:29,582
It'll appeal
to your sense of drama.

788
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:31,582
- Jane...
- Here we have...

789
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:34,124
a magic doorway.

790
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:48,916
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

791
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:51,332
this is where

792
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,874
the sadly neurotic singer
created some of her finest work.

793
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,457
And behind this curtain,
we have a lovely array

794
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:02,832
of...

795
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,957
music-recording equipment.

796
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:08,832
Of course, the other
instrumentation and final mixing

797
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,541
were done elsewhere by
my best friend, my producer...

798
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:16,791
my face.

799
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:19,332
-Jane, if you only read
what I’ve written...

800
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:22,332
-Over here, we have
a series of songs

801
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:26,041
that no one has ever heard.

802
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:28,499
Black screams with happy faces.

803
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:31,041
- Yes, ladies and gentlemen...
- Jane...

804
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:35,499
-You're so right.

805
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:38,374
I think we should start.

806
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,999
-Stan?

807
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:44,499
-Well.

808
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:47,291
We can get comfortable first.

809
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:56,499
You like me?

810
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:59,541
-Yes. You know I do.

811
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:04,999
-I love your body.

812
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:10,999
- I've loved watching you work.
- Jane...

813
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:13,124
-Come on, Norm.

814
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:15,457
Every story needs
a tender love scene.

815
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:17,832
- This isn't a story.
- Yes, it is.

816
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:46,957
So...

817
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:51,707
ask me a question.

818
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:54,874
-Why are you doing this?

819
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,457
-Good question.

820
01:16:57,583 --> 01:16:59,457
I think it has something to do

821
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:02,832
with the geopolitical
menace of terrorism

822
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:05,374
and our responsibility
to the third-world nations...

823
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,416
- I love you.
- Shut up!

824
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,874
Ask me how I got started.

825
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,541
Norm, the interview.

826
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:19,916
Ask.

827
01:17:20,042 --> 01:17:23,041
-How did you get started?

828
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:25,916
-I just started.

829
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,374
That's a little dull, isn't it?

830
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:32,791
Okay, let's see...

831
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:36,874
Uh, Madelaine and I
had been friends

832
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,999
since we were young.

833
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:42,791
And one day,
we made an arrangement.

834
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:46,666
She was much more socially sexy

835
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:49,541
and knew the music biz
and I could sing.

836
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:52,999
I never dreamt...

837
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,999
Ask me why I'm a recluse.

838
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:00,832
"Why are you a recluse, Jane?"

839
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,624
Uh, that's an interesting
question.

840
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:07,291
I guess... I guess
the best way to put it

841
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:10,166
is that some people are good at
parties and some people aren't.

842
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:16,499
Oh!

843
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:18,499
Yes, thank you.

844
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:21,291
I am very special and talented.

845
01:18:21,417 --> 01:18:23,999
Oh, yes, really, I am.

846
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:28,832
It comes to me in flashes,
you see.

847
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,332
Anecdotes?

848
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:36,082
Oh, I have a raft of them.

849
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:38,791
In fact, my whole life is just

850
01:18:38,917 --> 01:18:42,832
one big media anecdote.

851
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:44,832
[moaning]

852
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:47,332
-ls that good?

853
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,832
-Jane, listen to me.

854
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,832
Listen to me, Jane.

855
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,666
I love you.

856
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:58,666
Don't you realize
how much I love you?

857
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:01,291
- And then...
- I met a fine young man

858
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:03,249
at my own funeral.

859
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:05,582
And he was interested
in gardening

860
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:09,166
- and I was interested in him.
- It's okay.

861
01:19:09,292 --> 01:19:11,499
It's okay. Listen to me.

862
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:14,249
I promise I won't hurt you.

863
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:16,249
-Oh!

864
01:19:16,375 --> 01:19:17,791
Really?

865
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:23,541
Ask me about one of the most
exciting moments of my life.

866
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:26,832
- Please don't play this game.
- No! Ask!

867
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,249
-What was one of the most
exciting moments of your life?

868
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:31,999
-Oh, God.

869
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:36,207
I'm so glad you asked me
that question.

870
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:41,541
Now...

871
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:51,624
Now, one of the most exciting
moments of my life.

872
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,499
I was home alone, a while ago,

873
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:57,791
just rehearsing one of my songs,

874
01:19:57,917 --> 01:20:01,124
when I received
an unexpected guest.

875
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:06,082
And he cut my face and my arms.

876
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:09,791
And he pushed me to the ground.

877
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:12,707
And he ripped my clothes.

878
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:14,791
-That wasn't you.

879
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,499
That wasn't your fault.

880
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:24,624
-And then I heard my own voice
far, far away, screaming

881
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:28,624
and screaming and screaming...

882
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:32,374
-"No-♩-♩-♩..."

883
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,249
[crying]

884
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:02,249
-It's okay, it's okay.

885
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:05,499
It's your hands, it's your face,
you're here.

886
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,999
It's okay, it's okay.

887
01:21:26,542 --> 01:21:28,416
[car door slamming]

888
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:30,207
[faraway voices]

889
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:34,207
[car door slamming]

890
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:38,707
[louder voices]

891
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:52,166
-Hey, Jane! Jane, it's Zelda.

892
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:54,207
I know that you've
gotta be in there and...

893
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:55,999
Why don't you just
come on out here?

894
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:58,957
There's a few people who want
to just ask you a few questions.

895
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:00,957
It's no big hairy deal.

896
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,416
We just wanna, uh...

897
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:05,749
sort of like an impromptu
press conference here, okay?

898
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:09,499
So just come on out. Don't be
worried about anything. Okay?

899
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,124
-We'll meet in 12 hours,
all right?

900
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:19,124
Jane, are you all right?

901
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:23,124
It'll work, I promise you.
It's the only way.

902
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:26,124
Say you understand.

903
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:28,666
All right?

904
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:32,791
All right.

905
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:36,457
-Ladies and gentlemen...

906
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:38,124
-There she is.

907
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,999
-I will speak to you,
but not here.

908
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:46,207
Let me bring you
to my recording studio.

909
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:49,332
And I will answer
all your questions there.

910
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:51,499
[babble of voices]

911
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:34,082
[babble of voices]

912
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:42,916
- Come on. Hurry up, everyone.
- She's ready to talk. Come on.

913
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:48,041
Can you do both of us
at the same time, because...

914
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:51,624
Okay, sshhh, sshhh. Okay.

915
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:55,999
- What's going on here?
- Oh my God.

916
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:58,374
-I'm sorry to have deceived you,

917
01:23:58,542 --> 01:24:00,707
but it was the only way
to protect her.

918
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:03,999
I led you here so that
she could escape.

919
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:06,499
Please, please, please.

920
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,666
She's a very fragile woman.

921
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:11,166
And she prays that you'll
let her live quietly.

922
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,999
And she asked me to tell you,

923
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:16,374
to thank you
for listening to her songs.

924
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:19,166
And she also asked me
to say goodbye.

925
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:21,499
[babble of voices]
Thank you.

926
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,499
[Zelda]: She was a personal
friend of mine, so I actually...

927
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,999
-Hey, lady, lady,
is that your kid in there?

928
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,166
- Hey, do you live here?
- Yes, I do.

929
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,207
- Who are you?
- There was a young man...

930
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:57,041
- How does he know Madelaine X?
- Is he involved in music?

931
01:24:57,167 --> 01:24:59,957
- Is he a musician?
- Uh, one at a time, please.

932
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:02,832
Yes, Norm is very musical.

933
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:06,541
-Oh, Mother! No, no,
I'm sorry, not you. No.

934
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:11,124
Uh, yeah, yeah. So that's
flight 871 , Toronto to Paris,

935
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:14,207
Air Canada,
this evening, 11 P.M.

936
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:18,541
All right, thank you.

937
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:21,416
-Actually, Norm's always been
quite creative.

938
01:25:21,542 --> 01:25:23,916
Very creative
and very sensitive.

939
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:26,416
That's his father's influence.

940
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:28,999
Actually, ever since
he was a very small boy,

941
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:31,624
I’ve always felt Norm
was somehow special.

942
01:25:35,042 --> 01:25:36,916
[narrator]: And finally,

943
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:39,541
Norman raced back
to rescue his princess.

944
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:08,874
-Jane!

945
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:26,541
[narrator]: But her heart
had been broken.

946
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,457
For her fear of the world
was much too great

947
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:38,874
and her refuge from it
had been destroyed.

948
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:44,416
So she had taken her own life.

949
01:27:06,167 --> 01:27:08,166
Norman did not know how to live

950
01:27:08,333 --> 01:27:11,291
in a world that had endings
like this.

951
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:14,332
He had wished for something
so very different.

952
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:20,124
So he concentrated
all of his powers,

953
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,332
all that he'd learned,

954
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,749
and all that he'd loved,

955
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:27,832
and turned back time.

956
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:48,791
And then he wrote himself

957
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:51,832
a much kinder ending
to the story.
