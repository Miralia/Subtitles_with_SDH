remember?

TOUR GUIDE ON PA:
This complex was only completed

537
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:14,999
handed over to the Royal Navy,
around two years ago.

538
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,624
It was opened by Prince Philip.

539
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,332
Thank you, my dear.

540
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,041
Ark Royal’s scrap will pay
for the desks in there.

541
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,416
Surface ships are a waste of time.

542
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:28,541

Icing on the cake.

543
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,624
Eh, Gill?

544
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,832
I went around this sub last year,
Navy days.

545
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,332
Stink, don't they?

546
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:39,457
They don't.

547
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,082
Anyway, I reckon I'd go around the bend

548
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,541
if I was stuck in one of them
for months on end.

549
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,166
Crews do go around the bend.

550
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:48,499
You can recognise deeps
straight off.

551
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,707
(HE CHUCKLES)
That and the round shoulders.

552
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,541
Would you go in subs?

553
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:58,957
Wouldn’t mind.

554
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,749
Don't get to see the light of day much
in a frigate, do I?

555
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,791
Besides,
don't always get the choice.

556
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,457
How do you mean?

557
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,916
They can't get the numbers, see?

558
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,207
They draft you
from the surface to the subs.

559
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:12,291
As long as you fit, you're in,
there ain't no two ways about it.

560
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,249
I'm going for fresh air.

561
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,207
Found our little sea legs, have we?

562
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,666
I got to go up the hospital
this afternoon.

563
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:28,957
See about that bloke.

564
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,582
They want me to talk to him.

565
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,957
Creepy, innit?

566
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,457
Frank ditched his wallet.

567
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:51,916
There's no identity on him.

568
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,291
What's the police attitude?

569
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:55,249
Usual. Don't want to know.

570
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,457
He is serious, is he?

571
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:57,541
Coma.

572
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,666
Shit.

573
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:02,291
Police might change their attitude,
you know, if he dies.

574
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,624
I'm not an idiot, Alf.

575
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,499
The MPs are asking questions.

576
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,666

- It's the identity thing.

578

They'd leave it alone otherwise,
wouldn't they?

579
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,541
Frank's such a bloody fool.

580
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,957
He panicked.

581
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,457
Helped himself to some cash,
more like.

582
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:21,499
Stupid boy.
Stupid little idiot.

583
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,082
He should never have been there.

584
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,541
OK, Alf, thanks.

Well, I got a mate
had an accident at work.

591
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:05,832
I said I'd visit.

592
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:09,332
This is our last day together
for six months, Mark.

593
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,166
I’m sorry.
I promised I would.

- I'm buggered if we...
- Well, it won't be long, Dad.

596
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:21,124
I’m buggered if we're going to just
stay here while you go off visiting.

597
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,541
Well, you can go to the Barbican,
can't you?

Perhaps we should go home.

599
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:27,374
I like the Barbican.

There's that tea shop
we went to once.

601
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:32,416
I know the one.

602
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,041
MARK'S MOTHER:
Oh, I don't care for that.

603
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,582
Oh, go on, Mum.

604

605
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:41,541
OK.

Maybe he isn't Navy.

608
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,999
But he's certainly military personnel.

609
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,624
Well, put calls out to the other
services then, can't you?

610
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,624
I want his parents here.
Do you understand?

611
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,957

Yeah.

621
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,582
Talk to him about them.

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

1597
01:45:13,208 --> 01:45:14,166
Morning.

1598
01:45:17,292 --> 01:45:18,207
Ta.

1599
01:45:18,958 --> 01:45:20,457
Going to see me off?

1600
01:45:44,458 --> 01:45:46,124
I haven't had a lot of time...

1601
01:45:54,833 --> 01:45:56,374
Thank you very much.

1602
01:45:57,167 --> 01:45:58,582
Ah. Oh, no.

Mark!

1606
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:36,666
Sorry, mate.
Ferry's going to dock in a minute.

1607
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:40,332
You OK?

1608
01:46:44,167 --> 01:46:46,457
Maybe it was cos I sort of
recognised him.

1609
01:46:48,667 --> 01:46:50,457
I didn't really know Malcolm White.

1610
01:46:51,792 --> 01:46:53,999
He was just leaving Raleigh
when I started there.

1611
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:58,957
But he was at that Remembrance Day
service we had to go to.

1612
01:47:00,375 --> 01:47:01,874
The one with the cinecamera.

1613
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:07,249
It was his brother
who was in the Army display team.

1614
01:47:08,917 --> 01:47:11,582
I must've recognised him
in some weird way.

1615
01:47:12,958 --> 01:47:15,082
That's why I started
talking to him and that...

1616
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:18,291
you know, down at Dol's.

1617
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:22,457
Well, he'd gone AWOL
from his camp in Dorset.

1618
01:47:23,583 --> 01:47:25,416
Hitched all the way to Plymouth.

1619
01:47:26,833 --> 01:47:28,041
He was scared to go home

1620
01:47:28,125 --> 01:47:30,041
so he came down here
to find his brother.

1621
01:47:32,292 --> 01:47:34,332
That's why he was
hanging around on his own.

1622
01:47:36,167 --> 01:47:37,499
He didn't know anyone.

1623
01:47:38,583 --> 01:47:40,499
He was too scared to say
who he was.

1624
01:47:41,667 --> 01:47:43,207
That's the brother, is it?

1625
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:45,082
Yeah, Malcolm.

1626
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:47,291
Yeah.

1627
01:47:47,917 --> 01:47:49,374
You know, I do know him.

1628
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,707
I mean, vaguely.

1629
01:47:50,792 --> 01:47:52,624
NAVAL OFFICER:
Come on, lads, ferry's leaving.

1630
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:56,707
Can you see this gets to White?

1631
01:47:57,542 --> 01:47:59,041
He's the one up at the hospital.

1632
01:47:59,792 --> 01:48:01,124
He's still there, ain't he?

1633
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:03,957
His brother died during the night.

1634
01:48:04,833 --> 01:48:06,207
NAVAL OFFICER:
Right, I’ll see to it.

1635
01:48:07,458 --> 01:48:08,749
You mean he's dead?

1636
01:48:10,417 --> 01:48:11,666
Christ.

1637
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:16,499
Why'd he go AWOL?

1638
01:48:16,958 --> 01:48:18,207
Dunno.

1639
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:20,666
Leave cancelled or something.

1640
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:23,541
Off to Belfast, probably.

1641
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:27,582
Perhaps it was just to say cheerio.

1642
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,124
That's important sometimes.
