173
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,292
and I'll wait on you.

174
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,595
- Thank you.
- Here you are.

175
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,266
I’ve got...
Here's today's paper.

176
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,102
Oh, thank you very much indeed.

THE COLONIST. [LAUGHS]

178
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,577
The colonist...

179
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,515
All of this science
and development,

180
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,585
and here we are, still on
the brink of extinction.

181
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,855
Corporate greed and our
desperate desire for more oil,

182
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,257
that'll be our undoing.
It's--we'll kill everyone,

183
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,060
and we'll call it
"the fight for freedom."

184
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,596
So what, you're anti-technology?

185
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:50,101
No, I'm not anti-technology.
No, I’m more... pro-ecology.

186
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,337
It's all in the book.

187
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,606
Uh, what book?

188
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,643
- The one I gave you.
- [Gasps] Oh, it's your book?

189
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,078
It's not actually a new book.

190
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,081
It's more of a reprinting of something
I came out with some time ago.

191
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,986
It's actually the basis of my...
Master's thesis.

192
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:13,258
It's about organic farming and a particular
strain of wheat that's been very robust.

193
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,261
Yes. Quite a best-seller in...

194
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,096
Some circles.

195
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,433
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

196
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,702
You should read it.

197
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,773
[Chuckles] Oh yes, yes. Easy to tell
you're a professor, that's all.

198
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,775
Oh.

199
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,078
Oh, was I lecturing you?

200
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,951
Uh, so when is the ceremony?

201
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:44,188
Uh, Saturday, Saturday evening,
and I hope you might come.

202
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,059
Maybe. I-- I...
I mean, it's a mess.

203
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,695
I don't know if
I wanna leave Maria alone.

204
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:54,299
Well, no, it's hardly a ceremony
for a babe in arms. [Laughs]

205
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,902
- She's 1 0.
- 1 0?

206
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,707
- I thought she was a baby. I--
- nope.

207
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,377
I brought her
that little fluffy... toy.

208
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,079

00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:35,073
- Why are you sitting out here?
- Heh, wonderfully brisk, isn't it?

213
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,109
Yeah, but you'll catch a cold.
It's quite damp. Here.

214
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,211
Thank you.

215
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,982
I... just thought I'd put it
to some use before you threw it out.

216
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,185
[Nadia] Right. You'll...

217
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,788
- You'll probably need this then.
- Thank you.

218
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,059
Anyway, I have to step out
for a couple of hours,

219
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,061
so if you wanna go
for a walk or anything,

220
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,064
there's a spare set of keys on the mantel.
Just lock up behind you.

221
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,901
Maria's got her own set,
so she can let herself in...

222
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,471
- Sure.
- ...And I'll see you later.

223
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,641
Hmm.

Oh, hello.

233
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,402
Your mother's gone out.
I expect she'll be back soon.

I’m Emile, your great-uncle.

seen one of these before?

It's a typewriter.
Found it upstairs.

Your mother wants to throw it out, but...
I’m very fond of the old thing.

I... um, I'm just staying
for a short while.

241
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,269
I’m going to get a degree,

at the university.

- [Tom] Hey.

Oh, well, I’ve got the paperwork
right here.

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,670
What about my contract?

264
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,572
I don't know.
Talk to the guy that hired you.

265
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:31,275
Well, I did talk to him.
He asked me to paint your house.

266

Well, he's not paying for me.

you know, I’ve taken a good look, and i--

a little fix-up.

I didn't ask for your opinion,

any favors from anyone,

thank you very much.

272
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:47,225
Well, I’ve got an idea.
You could pay for it,

273
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,427
and then no one would be
doing you a favor, would they?

274
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,895
Could you just get your stuff
and get out of here?

275

Okay, just back up a second.

a fucking break. Come on.

- No, no, no, no.

to get your shit and leave.

You've done that before.

513
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,780
Yeah, I’ve been around engines
my whole life.

514
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:20,049
- Thank you for that.
- No problem.

515
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,187

get back to work.

with the progress I’ve been making.

- Will you let me help?
- Oh, no, that's okay. I’ve got it.

518
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,062
No, I insist.
I want to do something useful.

519

are a bit rusty, so...

- Please, put me to work.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

521
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,171

- There's that one.
- Yes.

525
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:57,586
You know, we used to have to
paint our house in the prairies,

526
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:59,689
oh, once a year.

527
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,792
There was very little shelter
from the elements, and so...

528
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,863
The buildings would blister
in the sun in the summer

529
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,999
and peel in the wind and
the snow in the winter.

530

this for a long time.

No.

00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:31,154
Yeah. You just hold that.

once or twice.

537
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:36,491
Now, lift it up,

538
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:39,362
and don't let it drip.
Lift it up. Good, good,

539
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:43,700
and then just roll it gently
onto the surface there. Good.

- Sorry about that.
- It's all my fault. No, I, i--

549
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:18,167
I splattered this paint rather
carelessly on the stairs,

550

came to the rescue.

so I'll put the rest in the fridge.

using the river system

all the way up to the Great Lakes,
and then...

It isn't how old you are
on the outside that matters.

01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,879
[Emile] Yes,
I'll be along in a minute.

858
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,583
What's taking him so long?
ls he all right?

859
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:10,685
We were talking.

860
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,821
Oh.

861
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,324
Well, you're gonna make him late,
and dinner's ready.

862
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,960
- I wanna go.
- Where?

863
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:21,563
To the award ceremony.
What do you think?

864
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:24,465
You've got school tomorrow,
and Tom's here.

865

You mean Tom, the guy who's
slopping paint all over our house?

866

That's not very nice.

conversation right now.

busy next weekend,

listen to your mother!

it's the main hall.

will look after her.
