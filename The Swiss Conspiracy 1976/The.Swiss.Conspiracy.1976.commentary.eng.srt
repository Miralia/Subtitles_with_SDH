00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,086
- [Dan] Welcome to the Blu-Ray commentary

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,338
for "The Swiss Conspiracy".

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,549
I'm Daniel R Budnick, please call me Dan,

4
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,552
podcaster, author, bon vivant.

5
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:14,555
And I'm here with the great Mr. Rob Kelly.

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,764
Rob, how are you?

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,850
- [Rob] Hi, Dan, I'm really
happy to be here with you.

8
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,561
I am a writer and podcaster as well.

9
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,937
I write a column about movies

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,606
called "Real Retro Cinema"
at thirteenthdimension.com.

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,734
And I host a podcast called "Fade Out",

12
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,237
which examines the Hollywood
careers of actors, directors,

13
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,113
and producers and others

14
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,906
through the prism of their final film.

15
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,741
(movie chatters)

16
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,535
- [Dan] So we start off
here with some great text

17
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,870
and a guy reading the text,

18
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,331
in case we are having problems reading it.

19
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,292
I love the text because, one, it, it, it,

20
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,128
I, I don't know if this was
originally on the movie.

21
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,755
It feels like something
they may have added in,

22
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,256
'cause maybe preview audiences said,

23
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,883
"Now what's a Swiss bank account?"

24
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,384
'Cause not everyone has, I don't have one,

25
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,053
my mother doesn't have one.

26
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,262
And, and I feel like it's almost-

27
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,263
- [Rob] That you know about (laughs).

28
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,390
- [Dan] Yes, well, that's my mom, right?

29
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,143
So, so, but, there's
something about the ellipsis

30
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,561
at the end of the first paragraph

31
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,563
and the small "B" at
the start of the second,

32
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,397
that makes me think,

33
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,233
did the German side of
the production do that?

34
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,485
But so we get a narrator,

35
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,569
he tells us about Swiss bank accounts,

36
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,489
and now we go into a completely
different sort of scene

37
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,282
in a classy restaurant,

38
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,701
and watch out for the guy with
the black pepper in the mob.

39
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,704
Black pepper means that's,
keep away from that one.

40
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,623
'Cause that guy might have a gun.

41
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,209
So, so, what, what do
you think of this, Rob?

42
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,461
Sort of like this, this
opening, this great sort of,

43
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,088
he's got a rifle in his pocket.

44
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,840
- [Rob] Oh, why don't movies
open like this anymore?

45
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,800
- [Dan] They should-

46
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,594
- [Rob] You know, they just
this kind of big Rivera,

47
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,680
crazy scene and we're gonna
explain later what it means,

48
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,225
but just a real grabber right at the top.

49
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,267
- [Dan] Yes, like-

50
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,102
- [Rob] Just bang, there it is.

51
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,978
- [Dan] And you watch
it, and if you like food,

52
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,397
the guy is serving up like
veal or something like that,

53
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,149
whatever that meat, that meat is.

54
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,027
And now we go, I love it
because we go from the narration

55
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,824
to the shoot, this random
shooting, to the postcards,

56
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,659
and there's a train pushing a thing

57
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,661
up a hill just like we'll
see later in the movie.

58
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,246
I don't think I noticed that before,

59
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,124
but we get this, I love this
because we get this great,

60
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,625
"Hey, it's Switzerland

61
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,377
and we have this wonderful,"

62
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,962
this is, this is what Switzerland is like

63
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,588
to the average person, right?

64
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,090
It's, it's, it's-

65
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,299
- [Rob] Scenic, right, yeah, yep.

66
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,093
- [Dan] Bratwurst and
beer and scenic and Alps

67
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:16,927
and buildings that look like this

68
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,929
and this 'Oom-Pah-Pah" music,

69
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,597
which frankly drives me up the wall.

70
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,266
- [Rob] (chuckles) By the way,

71
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,184
I love "The Swiss
Conspiracy" getting bigger

72
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,018
and bigger and bigger.

73
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,354
I just love, it's like
very "Goodfellas" credits.

74
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,856
- [Dan] Yes, yes!

75
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,815
- [Rob] You know, when they
zoom in and stuff, it's great.

76
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,649
- [Dan] They're ready to go.

77
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,402
Yeah, and, and the film will
do an interesting thing here

78
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,613
because twice within the
movie, we start in the center

79
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,366
of Zurich and like one
time, like in a parking lot,

80
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,201
both times in parking lots actually.

81
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,954
But then that journey ends
in the gorgeous mountains.

82
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,456
In the opening credits we do the opposite.

83
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,624
We start off in the mountains

84
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,128
and we go into the heart of
Zurich, to the Hurtil Bank.

85
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,172
So, but before we do anything else,

86
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,173
I just wanna say that this,

87
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,508
this podcast, this podcast,
this, this commentary,

88
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,261
what we're gonna do is we're
going to, we're going to just,

89
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,513
we're gonna cover the movie
as you see it before you,

90
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,223
but we're also gonna
talk about the directors,

91
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,809
some of the actors, we're
gonna give some reviews.

92
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,769
There's a wonderful novelization

93
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,396
and I've got a gentleman here who might

94
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,481
be doing some dramatic
readings from that later on.

95
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,775
- [Rob] (laughs) It's,
it's a hell of a read.

96
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,944
I'll, I'll say, you've read it too.

97
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,112
- [Dan] Yes, I have, I
just finished it yesterday.

98
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,405
- [Rob] It's, it's, it's really something.

99
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,908
- [Dan] Yeah, Dixie
Sensburg is my favorite name

100
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,035
for a German or Swiss person I have.

101
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,411
(Rob chuckles)

102
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,704
[Dan] But yeah, it's, it's a,

103
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,664
we’ll talk more about the
novelization, which is written

104
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,125
by Michael Stanley, one of the four

105
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,003
or five writers on the movie.

106
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,631
But what, we will talk about
the great Jack Arnold shortly.

107
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,465
- [Rob] Yeah.

108
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,218
- [Dan] Who at this point was
kind of going out of movies

109
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,594
and doing lots and lots of TV,

110
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,971
although he'd done lots of
TV through the past decade,

111
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,891
but this is his last theatrical.

112
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,309
But we will talk about that.

113
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,771
I'm not counting "The
Wackiest Wagon in the West",

114
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,191
but, so now we are going into Hurtil Bank

115
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,068
and the movie is beginning.

116
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,819
(funky synthesizer music)

117
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,946
- [Rob] There you go, now this is, okay,

118
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,698
now we're gonna find,
it's a very curious way

119
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,451
of delivering a message
here in this movie.

120
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,953
There it is, right there!

121
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,287
- [Dan] Yes, there, there it is!

122
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,164
And, and the funny thing is, you'll see,

123
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,457
I don't know if you see it in this shot

124
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,042
or the next one, there's
an interesting moment

125
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:17,047
where you’ll actually see if, if he looks

126
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,340
up from where he's standing,

127
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,801
there are two guys sitting
at a desk, like right there.

128
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,635
- [Rob] Yep.

129
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,928
- [Dan] So there are
Literally, yeah, right there

130
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,346
on the left, oh, they're not there now.

131
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,182
But in the next, the
second time it happens,

132
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,185
near about 45 minutes into the movie,

133
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,812
there are literally two
guys sitting right there.

134
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,982
And you think, one, "Who
dropped that envelope there?"

135
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,816
- [Rob] (laughs) Right.

136
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,234
- [Dan] Logically at
this point in the movie,

137
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,152
who dropped that envelope there?

138
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,654
And the second time it happens, you sort

139
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,239
of have someone who could have dropped it,

140
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,741
but wouldn't those two guys
who are like staring right

141
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,993
at that point see it?

142
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,995
I don't, and this is great too,

143
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,871
because you get this
moment where suddenly there

144
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,456
are 40 secretaries in the room.

145
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,541
So I love this, this is,

146
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,668
I don't understand the
way Swiss banks work.

147
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,502
(Rob chuckles)

148
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,671
All I have is the information they gave us

149
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,631
over the, the, the text.

150
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,550
- [Rob] Well, Dan, I mean,

151
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,926
if you did know how Swiss Banks work,

152
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,386
would you admit that, anyway?

153
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,430
- [Dan] But that's true,
I'm not allowed to.

154
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,265
So I, I will say to you, yes, please.

155
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,266
- [Rob] Oh, I just wanna mention here

156
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,269
that having flown a lot
recently, this to me is one

157
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,353
of the more suspenseful scenes

158
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,272
is whether this guy's gonna get his bag.

159
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,106
(Dan laughs)

160
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,691
Because I find checking my bag

161
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,527
and expecting the airport
to deliver it, the airline

162
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,611
to deliver it where it says it's gonna

163
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,363
be to be very stressful.

164
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,197
- [Dan] Hilariously stressful.

165
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,490
- [Rob] So I'm glad
John Saxon gets his bag,

166
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,993
but yeah, I found, my pulse was pound-,

167
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,328
pounding when I was watching.

168
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,747
I was like, "That bag gonna show up?"

169
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,624
- [Dan] Yeah, (laughs) so we are in Zurich

170
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,835
and it is the great John
Saxon playing the character,

171
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,462
Hayes, now, in this movie.

172
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,588
Now, obviously we're gonna

173
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,256
be spoiling everything about this movie,

174
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,050
so if you've seen, you
should've seen this movie.

175
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,219
'cause the movie does have
a twister-ooney of an ending

176
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,389
and a lot of side trips.

177
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,266
But yeah, so he's playing Hayes

178
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,851
and there are, there
are five people blank,

179
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,935
blackmailed in the movie.

180
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,937
One of them was the gentleman
killed in the beginning,

181
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,522
Rasher, this is Hayes.

182
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,400
We're gonna meet Abbott,
who's the lovely young lady.

183
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,610
We're going to meet McGowan,

184
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,946
who's the older John
Ireland-like gentleman.

185
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,783
And then, I suddenly, Kosta,
is that the fifth guy?

186
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,034
- [Rob] I believe, yeah, I think so, yeah.

187
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,245
- [Dan] The really disinterested
guy who's like, "Oh, God,"

188
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,039
who looks like he gets
blackmailed every day, you know?

189
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,499
"Oh, I'm so bored with this."

190
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,750
(Rob chuckles)

191
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,959
So one, one of the things I do love

192
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:18,794
about the opening of this,

193
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,420
I mean, we have the, the, the text,

194
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,422
we have that shooting
in a random restaurant,

195
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,217
we have the "Oom-Pah-Pah" music,
we have the gorgeous Alps,

196
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,385
we go into a bank,

197
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,012
now we're following John
Saxon out of an airport.

198
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,181
It's just, it's this
whole sort of (grunts)

199
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,683
of, "What is going on?"

200
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,185
And if you're reading the novel,

201
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,436
this is actual, novelization,

202
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,938
this is actually like 40 or 50 pages in

203
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,399
'cause there's a lot of background.

204
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,692
- [Rob] (laughs) Yeah, yeah,
I mean one of the things that,

205
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,363
that of course is truism
of movie novelizations, of,

206
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,241
of, you know, book novelizations
of movies is they have

207
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,617
so much more space to fill.

208
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,451
- [Dan] Yes.

209
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,828
- [Rob] So there's just so much more,

210
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,456
every character gets 20
to 30 pages of backstory.

211
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,290
- [Dan] (laughs) Yeah.

212
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,750
- [Rob] And there are, again, we'll,

213
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,127
we'll talk about it a little
bit later, but there are a lot,

214
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,545
there's lots of stuff in the book that is

215
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,338
so not in this movie.

216
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,172
- [Dan] Yes.

217
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,507
- [Rob] This, this movie's
pretty straightforward,

218
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,926
87 minutes, you know, it's
just bing, bing, bing,

219
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,929
just very direct, it's, it's not a whole,

220
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,305
it's not a really big character piece,

221
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,807
which is not a criticism at it.

222
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,600
It's just, it's, this is the plot,

223
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,893
we're gonna watch these
people go through it.

224
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,520
Ah, Ray Milland, the great Ray Milland!

225
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,440
- [Dan] And Anton
Diffring, two, two greats,

226
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,941
and the great Ray Milland.

227
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,651
I, I'd love to talk about Ray Milland now,

228
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,278
but I think we're gonna
save our actor stuff

229
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,571
for when we've calmed down a bit.

230
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,405
'Cause right now we're kind

231
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,489
of coasting on all the stuff happening.

232
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,699
- [Rob] Setting up all the plot.

233
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,617
- [Dan] Yes, yeah, so, so I, I did,

234
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,244
according to the novelization,

235
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:39,332
approximately 40%% of the Hurtil
Bank is Swiss bank accounts.

236
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,250
(Rob hums and movie chatters)

237
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,585
And, and so, and one of the things

238
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,463
that makes Swiss bank
accounts so wonderful

239
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,841
for these banks is they are
a lot of criminals, a lot

240
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,844
of dictators, a lot of very
shady people put their money in,

241
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,848
and if they die and no one
knows about the account,

242
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,683
the money goes to the bank.

243
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,684
- [Rob] Good deal.

244
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,227
- [Dan] So, so that's
actually a pretty good deal.

245
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,563
So, so like taking on a
South American dictator

246
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,815
who's got 10 million bucks or something,

247
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,691
you know, you put it in there,

248
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,110
if he dies, no one's
gonna come step forward.

249
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:07,944
You're not gonna get a bunch

250
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,613
of revolutionaries
coming in the front door.

251
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,282
That guard, that guard actually
wouldn't see them probably

252
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,408
if they came through the front door.

253
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,242
(Rob laughs)

254
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,536
But, but the, but the, you
know, they, the, you know, and,

255
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,288
and that's kind of one
of the reasons why it's

256
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,582
so lucrative for them.

257
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,791
And I guess they're neutral

258
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,461
and they don't care particularly, right?

259
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,462
- [Rob] Yeah, I mean this is their,

260
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,922
their number one concern is the pr-,

261
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,925
I mean, the whole, the
whole hook of this movie is

262
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,302
that they're just gonna get exposed.

263
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,136
- [Dan] Yes!

264
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,471
- [Rob] You know, like that's
it really, it's not even like,

265
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,639
"Oh, we're gonna expose you

266
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,516
and you've also done
some nefarious things."

267
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,184
I mean, although some people have.

268
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,018
- [Dan] Yeah.

269
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,102
- [Rob] But it really is just your name

270
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,063
is gonna get promoted and
we don't even want that,

271
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,898
which is just kind of amazing.

272
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,442
- [Dan] Yeah, you get Hayes,
the John Saxon character,

273
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,278
is the only one who's really cheesed off.

274
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,321
- [Rob] Right (chuckles).

275
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,323
- [Dan] And it's happened,
but, but then the more you sort

276
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:57,452
of look at what he's doing
and why he's so cheesed off.

277
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,247
And then when he gets mad
at the great, we're about

278
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,082
to see him soon, the
great Mr. David Janssen.

279
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,250
- [Rob] Yeah!

280
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,084
- [Dan] His, his, I'd like

281
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,252
to talk about later when
the assassins are going

282
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,629
after Christopher, I want to
talk about how confused I get

283
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,755
by that plot line.

284
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,298
(Rob laughs)

285
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,841
But right now we're gonna talk about,

286
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,594
now, in today we call this a "meet cute",

287
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,805
that's about to, I think
it's about to happen.

288
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,057
And Hurtil, that's Hurtil Bank.

289
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:19,891
- [Rob] There he is!

290
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,725
- [Dan] Dennis, Denise, you have

291
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,560
to pronounce it as "turtle".

292
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,602
There he is, and we,

293
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,521
we would call this a "meet cute" today.

294
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,482
I call it a "meet gruff"
because it's David Janssen.

295
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,483
(Rob laughs)

296
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,943
And how old is he right there?

297
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,528
He's like in his late 40s, right?

298
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,029
- [Rob] He is, let's see, he,

299
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,740
he unfortunately passed
away very young at 49.

300
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,826
And this is '76, '75.

301
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,660
- [Dan] Yeah, made in '75.

302
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,828
- [Rob] So he was 44 when he made this.

303
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,246
- [Dan] Oh, my goodness.

304
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,080
- [Rob] I mean, good lord,

305
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,415
I'm older than David Janssen is now.

306
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,249
I don't feel like-

307
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,250
- [Dan] Yes.

308
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,084
- [Rob] (laughs) I think
he looks older than me,

309
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:46,960
I think, I don't know.

310
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,463
- [Dan] Wow, I, I was, I was
still getting carded at 44.

311
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,882
- [Rob] (laughs) Guys just, people just

312
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,842
looked older back then.

313
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,801
- [Dan] Yes, they did!

314
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,635
- [Rob] They did.

315
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,553
- [Dan] And if, if you see
pictures of him like, now,

316
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,471
I've never seen "Richard
Diamond, Private Detective",

317
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,806
which I feel like I should have seen

318
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,933
because I'm such a fan of David Janssen.

319
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,810
I'm saving it for retirement.

320
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,769
(Rob laughs)

321
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,272
But, but in that, he kind of looks young.

322
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,025
I mean, that's like 1 5
years or so before this.

323
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,444
And he kind of looks young-ish.

324
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,070
Maybe it's 'cause it's black and white.

325
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,533
But yeah, so here he is, our
star, Mr. David Christopher,

326
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,244
I'm just gonna call him
"our David" throughout.

327
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,579
And meeting up with Denise Abbott,

328
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,039
they do this wonderful thing here,

329
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:24,873
which actually I think I've seen

330
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,001
in a "Mr. Show" sketch like
a couple decades later,

331
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,337
where they just meet awkwardly
and then they realize-

332
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,171
- [Rob] Yeah, they keep going

333
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,172
to the next thing, right,
right, right, yeah.

334
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,425
- [Dan] They're, they're going
to the exact same space and-

335
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,968
- [Rob] Senta Berger,
we should mention here,

336
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,303
he's meeting Senta Berger, yes.

337
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,305
- [Dan] Yes, yes, and we're go,

338
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,932
and it's, it's a, it's, I
will say one tricky thing,

339
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,143
I didn't, I didn't realize
until I read the novelization

340
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,687
and watched this like a
third or fourth time that

341
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,272
for being a movie about
a Swiss bank account

342
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,191
and that being kind of
like a secretive thing

343
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,068
that you think you might wanna sort

344
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,653
of bring the viewer in on,

345
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,904
they don't do that at all.

346
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,738
- [Rob] Nope.

347
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,572
- [Dan] In the movie, which is weird

348
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,908
because like basically
what we're seeing now

349
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,786
of the bank, that opening walkway,

350
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,996
the secretary room, briefly 'Benigen',

351
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,042
who is an Anton Diffring's
office, and then Hurtil's office,

352
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,919
and again, I'm gonna pronounce
it like "turtle", like,

353
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,006
like Denise Abbott does, all,
that's all we see of the bank,

354
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,841
which is a little odd.

355
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,551
And again, I'm gonna mention
that later when I talk

356
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,388
about Mr. Christopher's
investigatory style.

357
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,140
But what is going on here?

358
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,600
Oh, yes, Hayes, Hayes arrived.

359
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,060
- [Rob] Yeah, Hayes is showing up now.

360
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,978
I, did you get the same
read from this movie?

361
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,481
I watched this movie
several times, you know,

362
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,025
to station to this, but
didn't you get the sense

363
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,736
that this feels, and this
is not a knock at all,

364
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,280
but doesn't, it feels
a little bit like this

365
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,783
is the TV movie version.

366
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,909
Oh, this is the movie version

367
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,036
of a TV show starring David Janssen

368
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,788
as David Christopher, right?

369
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,622
- [Dan] Yes, yes!

370
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,581
- [Rob] Because everyone knows him

371
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,125
and he's kind of legendary.

372
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,001
And we're gonna find that
John Saxon's character

373
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,254
already knows him and
they have like a grudge.

374
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,381
You know, he's, "This
guy's justice", you know,

375
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,216
he's already like, and, and everyone's-

376
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,884
- [Dan] "You're gonna be
hanging in the meat house

377
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,344
with the rest of the pigs."

378
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,804
- [Rob] Exactly, everyone talks

379
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,182
about David Christopher like
he's this legendary law man

380
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,685
as if we kind of know
him already and we don't.

381
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,146
So it had the read like,
they finally were like,

382
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,188
"Oh, look, we got the money together

383
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,649
and we finally made a
David Christopher movie,"

384
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,151
after like six seasons (laughs).

385
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,278
- [Dan] Yeah, yeah, like
the show was on the air

386
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,654
for two, three, like, like a strange,

387
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,531
like when they did the
"Strangers with Candy" movie

388
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,949
or the "Trailer Park Boys" movie,

389
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,200
where it's like, it's not,

390
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,994
it's not a continuing thing deep in the,

391
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,163
it's like it went back
to the beginning again.

392
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,664
- [Rob] Or Batman.

393
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,498
- [Dan] But we all pretend like-

394
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,332
- [Rob] You know, the 60s
Batman movie, you know?

395
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,167
- [Dan] Yeah, yeah,
exactly, that's perfect,

396
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,460
perfect example, you have the 60s Batman,

397
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,961
or "A Man Called Flintstones".

398
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,714
- [Rob] (laughs) Wait, yes, or that.

399
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,132
- [Dan] Which would be a spy type thing.

400
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,884
So, which is sort of what this is like.

401
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,052
But, and he's playing,
this is, this is soon

402
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,388
after "Harry O" got
canceled and at the time-

403
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,473
- Right, and he said that he was never

404
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,932
gonna do TV again after that-

405
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:48,767
- [Dan] Yes.

406
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,894
- [Rob] Because he was so mad
about the show being canceled.

407
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,479
- [Dan] And, and he did,
he did a few TV movies,

408
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,189
he did "Superdome",

409
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,233
and I'm completely
blanking on what else he,

410
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,443
he was in "2 Minute Warning",

411
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,404
but that was a theatrical
around this time.

412
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,864
And, but we'll talk, we’ll talk more

413
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,907
about David Janssen later maybe.

414
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,741
- [Rob] Absolutely.

415
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,617
- [Dan] Maybe when he's flirting

416
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,286
with Ms. Abbott later
on and they're listening

417
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,996
to "Sloop John B." in German,
which we can talk about.

418
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,331
- [Rob] Oh, that is a, that's a moment.

419
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:15,710
- [Dan] It's fantastic,
so, so what we've got here,

420
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,213
yeah, is the, so what, what we get here,

421
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,130
and it's, it's kind of interesting

422
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,007
'cause if you read the novelization,

423
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,592
the novelization takes everything

424
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,053
that's happening in like
the first 20, 25 minutes

425
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,013
of this movie, which
is a lot of characters,

426
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,391
a lot of names, and it slows it down.

427
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,434
- [Rob] Yep.

428
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,393
- [Dan] So if you, if you
read the novel, if you were

429
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,437
to read the novelization first,

430
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,647
I think you would go into the movie

431
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,775
and you'd know the characters
so well that you wouldn't have

432
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,068
to piece things together.

433
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,111
But there is, it, it does a
thing which movies did back

434
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,739
in the 70s, which,

435
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,283
but back in the 60s too, which is like,

436
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,494
today, if a movie is making
a point about something

437
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,871
and it's not misdirection of some sort,

438
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,416
it lets you know what the point is.

439
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,086
You know, if someone is someone's mother,

440
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,797
they will let you know,
maybe the movie will stop

441
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,882
and some light music will play,

442
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,300
"That's his mother," (mimics light music),

443
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,636
something like that, but in
this one if it's his mother,

444
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,305
it'll be like, you know,
Mr. Christopher, our David,

445
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,723
will like, call his secretary and be like,

446
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,433
"I want you to check on
this and check on this

447
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,601
and check on this, check on his mother,

448
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,853
check on this, check out this, check out,

449
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,604
and that's all we’ll get, so like-

450
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,565
- [Rob] (laughs) They assumed audiences

451
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,191
were relatively intelligent back then

452
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,317
and you could piece things together.

453
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,151
- [Dan] Were, were
really paying attention.

454
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:22,986
Yeah, exactly.

455
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,820
- [Rob] Yeah!

456
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,029
- [Dan] With the, with a
great example being that,

457
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,823
that John Saxon's character, Hayes, works

458
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,992
for a big Chicago mob boss,

459
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,202
whose name is mentioned at least twice,

460
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,122
but both of the times it's
mentioned on phone calls.

461
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,623
And one of the times you
can't quite hear the name

462
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,667
because David Janssen is moving around.

463
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,502
And the second time it's just said

464
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,254
in with a mix of other names.

465
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,088
- [Rob] (chuckles) Right.

466
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,381
- [Dan] So that's, that's
kind of an important name,

467
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,507
but it's almost thrown away.

468
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,760
But it's not because you
should be paying attention.

469
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,970
I don't mean to be rude, anyone,

470
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,805
everyone just turned off the commentaries.

471
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,639
(Rob laughs)

472
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,850
"I don't want this jerk
telling me what to do,"

473
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,435
but it's David Janssen and Ray Milland,

474
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,145
everyone, don't you wanna
know what's going on?

475
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:57,979
They're drinking so much!

476
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,690
- [Rob] (laughs) And they also
assume you're gonna read all

477
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,442
that text in the beginning,
which they would never do now.

478
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,276
- [Dan] True.

479
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,110
- [Rob] You know what I mean?

480
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:04,944
- [Dan] True.

481
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,778
- [Rob] They're just not
gonna bother that, so.

482
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,613
- [Dan] Yeah.

483
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,447
- [Rob] I can't, I can't profess

484
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,781
to be an expert on David Janssen,

485
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,700
but I would, I get a read from him

486
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,327
in every movie I've ever seen him in,

487
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,288
is that he's one of those
guys who was great at acting

488
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:19,208
but also felt very conflicted
that he was doing this at all.

489
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,710
You know, like the George C. Scott,

490
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:24,172
George C. Scott was like, "Is
this really the job of a man?"

491
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,381
You know, that kind of, but you know,

492
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,215
and yet he was so great at,

493
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,134
'cause he just feels in every movie,

494
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,844
like he's just kinda like, "Ugh."

495
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,678
- [Dan] Yeah, exactly.

496
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,347
Like there are moments I love
the "Changeling" so much.

497
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,265
But then there are moments
that, where he's like,

498
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,850
"What do you want from me?"

499
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,643
(Rob laughs)

500
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,477
Where, you know, you're sort of thinking,

501
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,520
he's kind of thinking like,
"Am I really doing this?"

502
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,230
- [Rob] Exactly, exactly.

503
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,398
- [Dan] Like, "Is this?"

504
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,150
Yeah, but I, I sort of, I got that read

505
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,652
with David Janssen too, like he was-

506
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,986
- [Dan] Warren Oates was
another guy like that.

507
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,489
I, you know, there's a, I, I don't mean

508
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,323
to get too far off this,

509
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,450
but I remember there was a
great story I heard from,

510
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,035
from Wayne Rogers who was,

511
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,162
did a western with Warren Oats

512
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,580
and they were hiding behind something,

513
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,333
waiting for their cue,
and Warren Oats just said,

514
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,376
"Do you feel a little silly

515
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,044
about being grown men playing cowboy?"

516
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,672
Like (laughs) that's, I get that read

517
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,881
from David Janssen where he's just like,

518
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,092
"Look, I'll do this, but I just,

519
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,678
I just feel like maybe this
whole thing is, I, I could,

520
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,179
maybe I should be boxing

521
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,181
or something more manly
than what I'm doing."

522
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,350
- [Dan] Yeah, yeah, yeah,
this is a beauty of a scene

523
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,310
because you get John
Saxon, who as far as I,

524
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,687
who was acting for ages.

525
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,562
- [Rob] Oh, he's-

526
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,399
- [Dan] When he, when he
started off, they tried

527
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,858
to make him sort of a teen idol

528
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,986
and he's just kind of, he's
just, he's in everything.

529
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,279
He's in so much stuff
alongside David Janssen,

530
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,739
alongside the great Ray Milland,

531
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,157
who's has been in everything.

532
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,409
- [Rob] Yep.

533
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,244
- [Rob] And it's just,
and Anton Differing too.

534
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,705
I mean it's just this,
this great group of guys

535
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,915
and yeah, as you said, John Saxon, Hayes,

536
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,250
there is really swinging for the wall.

537
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,293
"Department of Justice, you're going,"

538
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,004
I already said the meat, meat house thing.

539
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,172
Oh, darn it, I should
have yelled that now.

540
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,591
- [Rob] I found a, I found a, a,

541
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,052
a great newspaper article in
the promotion of this film,

542
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,679
which is just about John Saxon

543
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,224
and the, the, the title
was "Success Suits Him",

544
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,518
which is like, well, yeah, all of us.

545
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,644
And he has this great quote where he said,

546
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,771
"Janssen and I had a lot of bull sessions

547
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,357
on 'The Swiss Conspiracy'
about the old days when we

548
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,068
were wondering if we'd get
the breaks that were beginning

549
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,279
to fall for Eastwood and Hudson."

550
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,113
- [Dan] Oh!

551
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:12,989
- [Rob] So (laughs) I love the idea

552
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,741
of these two guys sitting,
making this movie,

553
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,702
kind of bitching and moaning
about (laughs) the other actors

554
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,537
in this universal stable
that got the, yeah.

555
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,539
- [Dan] Eastwood and Hudson,
too, that's engaging (laughs).

556
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,958
(Rob laughs and grunts)

557
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:24,792
- [Rob] Yeah.

558
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,545
- [Dan] That's, yeah, 'cause
like I said, like, like I said,

559
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,964
Janssen was right off of
"Harry O" right here, which ran

560
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,924
for two seasons, two
TV movies, two seasons.

561
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,092
It's a really great show.

562
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,135
It's one of those shows that kind

563
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,763
of vanished sort of for decades.

564
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,597
- [Rob] Mmhmm.

565
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,639
- [Dan] But now if you
go on like your sort

566
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,809
of nostalgia stations, if they
have like a mystery block,

567
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,562
"Harry O" always seems to be on there now,

568
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,354
which is kind of weird

569
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,315
'cause it's alongside shows
like "Cannon", which ran

570
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,526
for five years, or "Barnaby
Jones", which ran for 80 years,

571
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,779
how long did "Barnaby Jones"
run... however long it ran for.

572
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,613
(Rob laughs)

573
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,031
But "Harry O" was only like two seasons

574
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,241
and it was like 40, 42 episodes.

575
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,452
So it's like they cycle
through them pretty quickly.

576
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,286
- [Rob] Yeah.

577
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,120
- [Dan] And, but he's great in that.

578
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,163
It's a great show.

579
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,832
And he's kind of playing a
"Harry O" variation here,

580
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,002
Harry, but, but with Harry you get,

581
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,505
Harry, in the first half of the series,

582
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,591
lived on a, a lovely beach house

583
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,259
and he's just on the beach building a boat

584
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,470
and people keep giving
him detective stuff to do.

585
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,971
And then the second half of the series,

586
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,348
he lives in a lovely apartment

587
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,767
in LA next door to Farrah Fawcett.

588
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,018
- [Rob] Eh, okay, I don't know,

589
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,020
beach house or Farrah
Fawcett, I don't know.

590
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,356
Hmm, would I make that
trade, I don't know.

591
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,025
- [Dan] So, and, and, and
now he's just this, this-

592
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,069
- [Rob] Drinking, a lot of drinking.

593
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,363
- [Dan] A lot of drink, I, I love that,

594
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,031
and it's, it's, it's funny, I,

595
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,492
what, the moment Anton Differing comes in

596
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,120
and gives Hurtil the, the, the, the letter

597
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,497
and they're comparing
the red sharpie on it.

598
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,207
And he, and the,

599
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,584
what's the first thing
Hurtil does when he sets

600
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,086
down his piece of paper?

601
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,087
(movie chatters)

602
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,171
Goes to get a drink.

603
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,382
Do you want a drink, of course!

604
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,466
And they, they all have drinks

605
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,594
and it's, it's a, it's a lovely
time here with the offices.

606
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,721
So, so yeah, we're just, we're, we're,

607
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,889
we're deep in the discussions.

608
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,641
We, we, we know the names

609
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,185
of the people now and we've obviously met,

610
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,020
we know that, I think we know that Rasher,

611
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:08,896
one of them, is dead.

612
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,690
He was the guy who got
shot through the window.

613
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,941
And we've met Denise Abbott

614
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,152
and we've met Hayes who is really pissed

615
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,445
off that our David's involved.

616
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,700
And McGowan, who's the older
Texas gentleman is flying in

617
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,534
and Kosta is-

618
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,451
- [Rob] Now we're meeting Charlie, yeah.

619
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,496
- [Dan] Yes, and Kosta's
coming in from Amsterdam

620
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,584
and yeah, yeah, at this point we're just,

621
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,294
he, he's, he's kind of,

622
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,297
we're, we're kind of just
doing a slight recap,

623
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,425
which this movie will do
again in about 40 minutes,

624
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,677
a slight recap of what's
happened and we're setting it up,

625
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,804
but we get the, we get
the great moment where,

626
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,807
where Anton Differing somewhere
in here says something like,

627
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,852
"We've got five very careless people."

628
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,312
And, and our David just gives 'em a look.

629
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,189
Like, "Not with these sort of accounts,

630
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,607
you don't get careless, come on."

631
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,526
And which is, which is a, which is, I like

632
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,696
because it's a slightly
suspicious thing to say, right?

633
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,530
- [Rob] Mmhmm.

634
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,615
- [Dan] Like if you're
second in command of the bank

635
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,701
and one of the things you do is

636
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:07,663
you have secret bank
accounts to just kind of say,

637
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,624
"Oh, yeah, it's nothing to do with us,

638
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,293
just five people being careless," eh.

639
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,252
- [Rob] (laughs) That's
got everything to do

640
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,712
with you guys, what are you talking about?

641
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,299
- [Dan] Yes, (laughs) yeah,
so, so what are we doing now?

642
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:23,387
Oh, yes, so we are, we are, oh,

643
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,680
we, actually, we are, this is cool

644
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,016
'cause we are about to meet two gentlemen.

645
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,853
There's, here, and here's,
here's sort of, I, I'm not, I'm,

646
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,104
I'm gonna go into this a little more

647
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,023
when we get Elke Sommer showing up first,

648
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,777
but the movie has a lot
of side journeys it takes.

649
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,611
- [Rob] Mmhmm.

650
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,488
- [Dan] And the novel,
novelization even more so.

651
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,031
So it is kind of one of those movies,

652
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,449
it's almost like an Agatha Christie kind

653
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,661
of thing where you have to
clear away a lot of like brush

654
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,871
in order to get to where you
need to be kind of thing.

655
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,249
- [Rob] Oh, here are, here are
our two henchmen, here are.

656
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,208
- [Dan] Here we go.

657
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,335
- [Rob] Jules and Vincent
of "The Swiss Conspiracy".

658
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,462
- [Dan] Yes, exactly, so, so there's,

659
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,839
and they're not, yeah,
they're not suspicious at all.

660
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,508
I mean, David Janssen,
I think at this moment,

661
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,386
he'd realty only been in
"Last House on the Left".

662
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,763
And I don't know that if
there was a huge crossover

663
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,932
between "Swiss Conspiracy
and "Last House on the Left".

664
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,809
There might have been, but I'm sure a lot

665
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,728
of people were like, "Oh, God,
good, the calvary is here.

666
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,771
We're, we're saved now."

667
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,605
(Rob laughs)

668
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,066
Or if they said, "Oh, everybody's dead."

669
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,942
- [Rob] By the way, I just wanna,

670
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,610
I just wanna mention this
actress 'cause she's,

671
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,570
this is it, this is her one scene.

672
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,365
Christiane Rücker, she's
the car rental clerk.

673
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,701
She was in movies like
"Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks"

674
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,494
and "The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism".

675
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,328
- [Dan] Sadism, aw.

676
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,871
- [Rob] Which is, I think
that's where I recognized her.

677
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,915
When I saw her I'm
like, "I know that face.

678
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,874
Where have I seen that face?"

679
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,376
I think that's what I saw her from.

680
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,961
- [Dan] Yeah, I know "Torture
Chamber" is, that's one

681
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,879
of Christopher Lee's, right?

682
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,714
I believe that's a Christopher Lee mo-,

683
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,008
and that's a German one I believe,

684
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,718
I think, I think that's a German film.

685
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,802
And "Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks",

686
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,721
of course everyone loves that.

687
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,723
I think there's a caveman
in that named Ook,

688
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,933
if I remember correctly,
I'm, I might be thinking

689
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,268
of a different "Frankenstein's
Castle of Freaks".

690
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,895
Oh, and now we are with, I
think her name is Corinne.

691
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,730
- [Rob] Yep.

692
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,564
- [Dan] He calls her Connie at one point.

693
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,732
This is Sheila Ruskin, who is-

694
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,276
- [Rob] She's, she's, she's,
she's answering a phone

695
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,903
on a "Star Wars" electronic
battle command game,

696
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,946
which is very confusing.

697
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:04,780
- [Dan] I was gonna say,

698
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,158
or she just got like a subscription
of "Sports Illustrated".

699
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,868
(Rob laughs)

700
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,494
They went, "Ooh, free fall?"

701
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,747
- [Rob] Good forearm strength
to lift that thing up.

702
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,914
- [Dan] (laughs) We'll, we'll take it.

703
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,041
So, so here we get, and,

704
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,585
and here's, here's kind of
with her, scenes with her,

705
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,587
yeah, she's a, she's a British actress.

706
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,213
She was in a lot of stuff in the 70s, 80s,

707
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,173
I actually know her best

708
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,676
for playing a character named
Cassie in a "Dr Who" serial,

709
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,386
"The Keeper of Traken" from 1981 ,

710
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,681
where she wore a huge red wig,
which is why it took me ages

711
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,433
to recognize her when I was watching this.

712
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,851
I sat there going, "I know her."

713
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,561
And then when I saw the name,
I was like, "Oh, finally."

714
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,063
But yeah, she's the secretary

715
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,148
and she's the high tech secretary.

716
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,775
- [Rob] Yeah, I need to
mention my favorite credit

717
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,610
from hers, just 'cause I'm
a nerd about this stuff.

718
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,320
She was in "I, Claudius".

719
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,154
- [Dan] Oh, yes!

720
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,447
- [Rob] Which is one of my
favorite things of all time.

721
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,783
She plays Vipsania in that.

722
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,452
And so I, every time that
anybody is in "I, Claudius",

723
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,830
I'm like, "Oh, okay, Elke
Sommer, here we go, Elke Sommer!"

724
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,000
- [Dan] So, so, so the
thing I love about this,

725
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,085
and I try, I was trying
to come up with a name

726
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,711
for what they're doing in this scene.

727
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,588
All I could think of was it's, they're,

728
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:06,467
they're engaged in specific vagueness.

729
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,301
(Rob laughs)

730
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,761
Because everything they say

731
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,806
in this implies that...
it's 'Bennigen', right?

732
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,725
That's not a restaurant,
that is, is that his name?

733
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,559
- [Rob] Benninger.

734
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,394
- [Dan] Anton Differing, Benninger!

735
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,520
I, 'Benigen', what an idiot.

736
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,523
So it's, I might just
call him Anton Differing.

737
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,149
I'm sorry, don't do that
again, so, but there's-

738
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,401
- [Rob] He's got a crocodile

739
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,235
on the wall wearing sunglasses, you know.

740
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,029
- [Dan] Yes, exactly, and there is Ms.,

741
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,907
Ms. Jensen, or Janssen, Jensen?

742
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,994
Elke Sommer, and they're two
German actors by the way.

743
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,038
And speaking very good English.

744
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,957
And the great thing about
this scene, like I said,

745
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,250
it's specific vagueness,

746
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,836
everything they're saying you could apply

747
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,587
to the blackmail scheme,

748
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,673
but you could also
apply to something else.

749
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,507
- [Rob] Right.

750
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,510
- [Dan] And at the very end,
because he's being vague

751
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,344
and then she says,

752
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,470
"What's this terrible
thing that's happening?"

753
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,097
And he says, "Dennis Christopher,

754
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,390
he's been put on the case."

755
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,683
- [Rob] See, the name again!

756
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,435
They say the name like it's
(mimics dramatic music),

757
00:23:59,146 --> 00:23:59,895
Dennis Christopher, ooh, boy!

758
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,021
- [Dan] "We'll put him on the case!"

759
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,149
And, and, and they're like,
it ends with a closeup

760
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,193
and like, "We're gonna have to
find a way to deal with him."

761
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,736
And it's like, and, and
your thought is, "Well,

762
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,113
we're only 24 minutes into the movie.

763
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,531
If this is a mystery at all,

764
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,158
these can't be the bad guys, right?"

765
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,492
- [Rob] Right, yeah, exactly, right.

766
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,326
- [Dan] I mean 'cause then it's,

767
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,494
now it's like "Colombo" or something.

768
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,579
We know that it's, it's, you know,

769
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,206
and you expect at the end of
that scene, you expect one

770
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,167
of them to say something
along the lines of like,

771
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,751
"What are we having for dinner?

772
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,128
I was thinking of fish."

773
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,130
"Great, I'll go buy some red herring."

774
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,090
(Rob laughs)

775
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,719
And, and because that's,
that's, sorry, this,

776
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,513
again, spoiler, that's exactly
what they are in there.

777
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,309
What they're, what they're
doing is so completely different

778
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,811
from what we're actually
doing in the movie that it's,

779
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,897
it's, you almost expect them

780
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,773
to be the people who
are doing it at the end

781
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,318
because it's so obviously not them.

782
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,445
- [Rob] That scene, I mean,
we'll find out exactly what,

783
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,655
what they're talking about
and why that's a double blind.

784
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,491
But it, it, it makes me think about, like,

785
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,493
I think you've seen, Steven
Soderbergh said recently

786
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,245
that cell phones have
ruined current thrillers

787
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,955
'cause everybody can just call everybody.

788
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,041
And it's like that, this
plot twist that comes

789
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,335
up is that they're, you know,
they're having an affair

790
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,586
and that's the big secret,

791
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,421
that wouldn't work as
a plot twist nowadays

792
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,881
'cause no one would care, you know?

793
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:09,715
- [Dan] Yeah, exactly.

794
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,258
- [Rob] Like, "The bank
manager's having an affair."

795
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,844
"So, like, what does that
have to do with my money?"

796
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,846
Like, you know (laughs)?

797
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,097
- [Dan] Exactly, and, and the big,

798
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,307
the big issue they're having,

799
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,642
and this is a bit of a spoiler,

800
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,602
but we're about to have
a fun fight scene here,

801
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,562
so I thought I'd just spoil
one of the, the big thing

802
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,564
with the Elke Sommers
character, Ms. Jensen,

803
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,317
there is that she doesn't
have the proper paperwork

804
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,735
to access a bank account.

805
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,820
And could you imagine if
there had been a big scene

806
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,198
where she like went in with
like a birth certificate

807
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,699
and it was a lot of shot cuts between,

808
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,577
"Here's my birth certificate,"
closeup of the teller's eyes,

809
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,038
closeup of the birth
certificate, dun, dun, dun, dun!

810
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,832
Closeup of her sweating, closeup
of Anton Differing looking

811
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,252
at her from a distance,
and then the person going,

812
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,921
"Everything's in order,"
stamp, stamp, dun, dun!

813
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:49,838
(Rob laughs)

814
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,549
That's why they didn't
follow that plot line,

815
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,259
is what I'm saying, because right here,

816
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:58,347
Hayes is, he's not,
he's not effing around.

817
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,724
- [Rob] No, he's just
firing wildly (laughs),

818
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,227
just trying in attempt to
kill Dennis Christopher, yeah.

819
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,562
- [Dan] He is, and I do, I do, one

820
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,397
of the things I applaud about
the movie is that, like,

821
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,984
it's a US, German
co-production shot in Zurich

822
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,153
and they have this big action
scene in a parking garage

823
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,114
that looked like it could
have been shot in Burbank.

824
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,991
(Rob laughs)

825
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,450
And it's a fun, it's a fun scene though.

826
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,786
I mean, it's lots of windows exploding,

827
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,122
and, and, and the fire extinguisher can.

828
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:23,956
- [Rob] It's a good, with
the fire extinguisher,

829
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,208
good gag, I like that, that's good.

830
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,209
- [Dan] And they really go for it here,

831
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,004
the two of them, they, oh (laughs).

832
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,589
- [Rob] This is a great fight, you know?

833
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,464
- [Dan] It is, it is a really good fight.

834
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,299
- [Rob] Looks real, wildly
punching each other.

835
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,550
Yeah, look at that.

836
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,384
Oh, elbow to the face!

837
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,969
- [Dan] It's nice, it's not like,

838
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,596
it's not a super dynamic fight,

839
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,389
although that was a nice little
tracking shot by the car.

840
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,974
It's not like a super
dynamic fight with a lot

841
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,767
of cuts and things like that.

842
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,144
It's just like two actors

843
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,770
and then occasionally two stunt men just

844
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,064
whomping the hell out of each other.

845
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,566
- [Rob] They're banging,
banging into each other.

846
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,109
- [Dan] Yeah, which is a
great way to, they're just,

847
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,235
it's just very visceral.

848
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,528
It's, it's a great fight.

849
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,696
And the whole time you're thinking,

850
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,947
"Mr. Hayes, if you wanted

851
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,492
to keep your blackmailing thing a secret,

852
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,660
this might be a mistake."

853
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,579
- [Rob] Yeah, I know, yeah,
see, he's laying it out

854
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,496
on the line here, oh,

855
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,540
now that the cops are gonna get involved.

856
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,750
- [Dan] Yeah, so these-

857
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,584
- [Rob] You flatfoots (laughs).

858
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,210
- [Dan] These goof, these goofball cops.

859
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,670
And then, and again, I will,

860
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,714
I will mention the
assassins more when they go

861
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,343
after Christopher, but I
do wonder if the assassins

862
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,137
are somewhere in here watching the cops,

863
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,556
watching Christopher, watching Hayes.

864
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,724
Because I, I love this,

865
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,226
two guys who just ran in
off the farm, just like-

866
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,354
- [Rob] (laughs) The guy in the overalls.

867
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,730
- [Dan] Just suddenly grab,

868
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,564
I love that it's a guy, I,

869
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,191
I'd like to think these are
like two guys on like the,

870
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,318
like maybe the Swedish crew

871
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,402
and they're like, "Could we do,"

872
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,821
I'm not gonna denigrate
myself and everyone by trying

873
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,823
to do a Swedish accent,
a Swiss, Swiss accent,

874
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,034
you know, sorry, yeah.

875
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,118
But you know, it's just like two guys

876
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,828
on the crew who are like
maybe the lighting guys.

877
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,038
"Could we run in and grab him?"

878
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,206
"Sure, yeah."

879
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,540
- [Rob] (laughs) He's
the prop guy from the,

880
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,376
the fire extinguisher, he had

881
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,669
to make sure that was working.

882
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,796
- [Dan] Exactly, and he
happened to be there.

883
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,589
And I don't know about the policing

884
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,882
that goes on in this scene

885
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,761
or it's, it's, it's, it's,
it's, it's, it's kind

886
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,596
of interesting because this is, there,

887
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,182
quite a bit of this
movie actually works best

888
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,685
when you watch the movie a second time.

889
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,895
And you know what, and I mean, you know,

890
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,439
this isn't an all time classic,

891
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,108
this isn't, say, "The French Connection",

892
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,318
although the title might try
to convince you otherwise.

893
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,529
- [Rob] (laughs) The titles,
they definitely were trying

894
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,614
to go for something with the, you know,

895
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,741
"French Connection"... "Swiss Conspiracy!"

896
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,867
- [Dan] Swiss Conspiracy, yes.

897
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,119
- [Rob] Yeah, you know about the,

898
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,371
the Spanish Interregnum, I mean (laughs).

899
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,790
- [Dan] Yes, there, there was, I had,

900
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,166
well, I, I had, what was it?

901
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,586
The, the, the Luxembourg Inheritance.

902
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,172
- [Rob] (laughs) Could do a
whole series of these things.

903
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,175
- [Dan] I, I had the Polish
Confusion was my favorite

904
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,802
... was that bad?

905
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,555
'Cause that one isn't set in Poland.

906
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,141
- [Rob] Right (laughs), right.

907
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,268
- [Dan] And, but, but,
but it has, but it has,

908
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,353
and even like we're about
to see in a few minutes,

909
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,147
it even does a French
Connection-y thing where,

910
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,692
with an action scene in
the middle of the movie,

911
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,943
the big action scene is in the middle

912
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,194
of the movie like the "French Connection".

913
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,028
- [Rob] Yep, yep, yep.

914
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:00,863
- [Dan] We’ll, we'll, we'll
talk about when they get

915
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,365
to that, but it's, it's,
it is one of those movies

916
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,492
that I think watching it
a second time really works

917
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,411
because, first off, like the
guy with the mustache here,

918
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,955
Captain Frey, I'll just call him the cop.

919
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,417
He, I guess he's a good cop, I don't know.

920
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,211
- [Rob] I, do we know
that, I mean, he seems,

921
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,381
he's always like three
steps behind everybody

922
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,466
in this case, you know?

923
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,509
- [Dan] He, he always,
he, yeah, he always shows

924
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:26,013
up a little late, he, he, you know, like,

925
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,097
we'll see in the final scene,

926
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,850
he shows up literally like
30 seconds from the end.

927
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,685
You know, it's like, "Really, guys?"

928
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,021
I mean, I'm sure like in the
end when he's on the ski lift,

929
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,856
he must see what's going on

930
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,816
and be like pounding the
ski lift going, "Go faster.

931
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,945
Go faster," but, but it's,
yeah, he's an interesting cop

932
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,656
because in about a half an
hour they'll give over like two

933
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,451
or three of the movie, mo-,
minutes of the movie to him,

934
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,702
which I feel is a strange thing.

935
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,912
But we'll talk about
that when we get to that.

936
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:55,000
So now we're at Hayes, and
Hayes is about to say goodbye.

937
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,752
- [Rob] Yeah.

938
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,755
- [Dan] And now, did
you think when you saw,

939
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,256
'cause Hayes yells out,
"We're gonna put you

940
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,383
in the meat yard," or
whatever we're doing to,

941
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,886
"We're gonna, I'm gonna,
you're gonna be taken care of."

942
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,680
Did you think when
these assassins arrived,

943
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,891
because they don't show in the
package who they're killing,

944
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,560
did you think they were going
after our Da-, our David?

945
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,561
(car screeches)

946
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,354
- [Rob] You know-

947
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,438
- [Dan] What did you always think?

948
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,564
- [Rob] You know, I, no, I think I,

949
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,151
I, at this point I gave
over to, when I watched this

950
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,987
for the first time, I gave
over to just being confused.

951
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,365
And I was like, "Okay, I don't
get why they're doing this.

952
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,493
And that's okay," and I
mentioned, you mentioned earlier

953
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,495
that like the, you know,
we find out just kind

954
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,122
of an offhanded line of
dialogue from David Janssen

955
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,916
that Rasher is the guy who gets killed

956
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,127
in the beginning, I, ashamedly,
I had to watch this movie,

957
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,295
I think three times before I picked

958
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,672
up that line of dialogue.

959
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,506
And I kept saying,

960
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,424
"Wait, who's the guy that
gets shot in the beginning?"

961
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,259
- [Dan] Yes!

962
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,343
- [Rob] And then I think

963
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,344
on the third pass I heard Janssen say,

964
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,346
"Rasher is the one who was killed."

965
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,266
I was like, "Oh, that's Rasher, okay!"

966
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,686
So I, I was okay with my
confusion throughout this movie

967
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,980
because I just let it
kind of wash over me.

968
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,815
I'm like, "Okay, this is a bunch of,

969
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,275
this is a movie about
a bunch of guys in a,

970
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,528
small rooms trying to, you
know, outdo one another

971
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,071
with occasional guest appearances

972
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,906
by Senta Berger and Elke Sommer,

973
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,074
you know what I mean?

974
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:09,950
- [Dan] (laughs) Exact, exactly.

975
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,034
- [Rob] I love that, I love him
running, John Saxon running.

976
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,619
- [Dan] Yes, yes, it's a great run.

977
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,162
And it's, I think it's, I
think it's an excellent scene.

978
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,331
Again, it's not like, it's
not like, like I said,

979
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,499
the "French Connection" in the middle

980
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,835
of it has the great
elevated train car chase.

981
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,587
- [Rob] I love this, all
these, all these kids.

982
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,421
- [Dan] Yes!

983
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,255
- [Rob] "Get out of my way!"

984
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,089
- [Dan] And that's just like,
that's just what they do

985
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,257
in Switzerland and they're neutral.

986
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,634
They can just hang out in an
alley, no one's gonna stop 'em.

987
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,468
(movie chatters)

988
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,553
- [Rob] "Hey, come on, let's party."

989
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,848
"No, leave me alone, I'm gonna,
chasing John Saxon, please.

990
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,391
There we go, get outta my way."

991
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,018
- [Dan] I feel like if
you watch a lot of sort

992
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,770
of American type films made in countries

993
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,189
that aren't America, you'll
get a lot of scenes like that,

994
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,858
where they think like
in this part of Europe,

995
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,402
people just hang out in like,

996
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,696
outside of bars just making lots of noise.

997
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,947
- [Rob] Yep, yep, yep.

998
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,032
- [Dan] And maybe they do,
maybe they do, I've never been.

999
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,783
- [Rob] Maybe, yeah, I don't know.

1000
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,744
Oh, here we go, this is, yes!

1001
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,953
(car zooms and wood rattles)

1002
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,371
- [Dan] There's some
nice stunting in here.

1003
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,331
It's, it's, it's a pretty good,

1004
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,374
it's not a dynamic chase scene,

1005
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,959
like the "French Connection" scene,

1006
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,128
which is just, you know, put the car in

1007
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,130
with the stunt driver and
have him do crazy stuff.

1008
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:08,175
And you're like, "Ah, ah," throughout or,

1009
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,886
or that beautiful moment
when like the, the,

1010
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,055
you see like the elevated
train going at top speed

1011
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,307
and then the car's just right
underneath it kind of thing.

1012
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,141
- [Rob] Yeah, yeah.

1013
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:16,975
- [Dan] It doesn't, it doesn't
have anything like that.

1014
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,310
This is more, this is more the kind

1015
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,063
of car chases you saw
on the Italian ripoffs

1016
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,898
of like "French Connection"
and "Bullet Serpico"

1017
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,692
in the 70s, which I know the name of them,

1018
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,944
but I've never said it out loud

1019
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,904
and I don't want to embarrass myself.

1020
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:33,408
It's, they're, it's
P-O-L-I-Z-Z-I-O, Polizzio,

1021
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,244
and then like T-S-C-H-E-I
or something like that.

1022
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,538
"Polizzio Tscheis" or something like that,

1023
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,540
films like "Syndicate Sadists"

1024
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,544
and "The Violent
Professionals" are like that.

1025
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,046
They're just these sort of,
I love this here, with the-

1026
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,881
- [Rob] This is a good
stunt here with the boom

1027
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,716
and then the, yeah, the
hood comes up on that.

1028
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,550
That's a great, you know?

1029
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,052
- [Dan] I do, I do, I do love that.

1030
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,972
And because, obviously, I,
I doubt that was planned

1031
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,890
and it's nice that the
hood went back down.

1032
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,724
- [Rob] Mmhmm.

1033
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,892
- [Dan] So, so, so it's
kind of, it's kind of cool.

1034
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,519
But unfortunately, we're
gonna lose Hayes here.

1035
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,604
- [Rob] Oh, man, ooh, right in the hand.

1036
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,774
- [Dan] Yeah, now, if you've
been reading the book,

1037
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,901
the novelization, we get a lot of,

1038
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,277
we get a lot of backstory.

1039
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,905
We know exactly what Hayes is up to.

1040
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,157
We know why these guys are after him.

1041
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,660
In the movie it's a little sketchier.

1042
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,536
- [Rob] Yeah.

1043
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,787
(wood creaks)

1044
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,747
- [Dan] I, I will tell
you, later on when they're

1045
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,709
after Christopher, give you,
give you a little sketching in

1046
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,337
of what's going on, just
to show my confusion

1047
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,047
with this hitman plot line.

1048
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:29,965
I mean, it's fun to watch.

1049
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,926
And in the novel when they
kill him, it's unpleasant.

1050
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,928
It's very unpleasant to read.

1051
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,805
- [Rob] Is this a small
role for David Hess?

1052
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,224
I feel like he was bigger
than this at this point.

1053
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,476
Like not a big star, but just,

1054
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,146
he's kind of an unnamed henchman.

1055
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,398
I don't know, this was a little
small for him at this point.

1056
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,983
I was almost like, "Oh, wait
a minute, it's David Hess."

1057
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,109
You know, like playing.

1058
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,777
- [Dan] (grunts) I think like, I,

1059
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,030
I think his main thing at this time had

1060
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,699
been like sort of "Last
House on the Left", so.

1061
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,575
- [Rob] All right, maybe
I'm just thinking of it,

1062
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,201
I'm looking at it from the, you know,

1063
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,536
50-year-tense kind of thing.

1064
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,080
- [Dan] Yeah, 'cause David Hess
started off as a songwriter,

1065
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,707
writing songs for Elvis.

1066
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,502
And he wrote "I Got Stung"
for Elvis, which was a,

1067
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,171
which was a hit, I think, I think, I think

1068
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,591
that "I Got Stung" in
history is, is important

1069
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,593
because it was like the
last song Elvis recorded

1070
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,220
before he went in the Army
at the end of the 50s.

1071
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,055
- [Rob] Hmm, okay.

1072
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,014
- [Dan] And David Hess
co-wrote it under like,

1073
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,517
the name David Hill or you know,
David Bubbles or something.

1074
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,770
It was a more fun name than David Hess,

1075
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,064
which sounds like a slightly
unpleasant name, you know?

1076
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,399
But from what I know,
though, he was a great guy.

1077
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,318
I know he's passed, but I'd hate

1078
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,487
to have his spirit
suddenly appear behind me

1079
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,947
during this commentary,
if I go dead on this-

1080
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:36,782
- [Rob] That would be
kind of cool, actually,

1081
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,075
to be honest with you,
that sounds kinda neat.

1082
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,451
- [Dan] Yeah, well, that'd
be great, maybe he could,

1083
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,328
he could add a little
extra to it (laughs), but,

1084
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,372
but yeah, I, I think this
is probably, at this time,

1085
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,374
probably okay for him.

1086
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,209
- [Rob] Okay.

1087
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,460
- [Dan] I, I think, and he's
definitely like, the two

1088
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,837
of them are a force to be reckoned with.

1089
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,630
- [Rob] Yeah.

1090
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,464
- [Dan] In the scenes they're in,

1091
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,007
they've got a couple more coming up and,

1092
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,801
but then you get a lot of
people in this movie who kind

1093
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,885
of show up and they're here

1094
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,053
for a bit and they do some things.

1095
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:03,141
It's a str-, I, I feel like
from reading the novelization,

1096
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,310
and this may, may be just me,

1097
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,187
I feel like the film
was meant to be longer.

1098
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,522
(hand taps)

1099
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,023
Do you, do you get that feeling or is it?

1100
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,691
- [Rob] Well, I mean, yeah.

1101
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,028
I mean, they probably, this
movie's a tight 87 minutes

1102
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,072
and the book is 300 pages.

1103
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:17,906
- [Dan] Yeah.

1104
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,740
- [Rob] But that's always the way, I mean,

1105
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,574
like I said, I've,

1106
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,534
I have a tough time
with novelizations just

1107
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,411
'cause they are so, I feel
like they're so padded.

1108
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,246
- [Dan] Yes!

1109
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,622
- [Rob] But they sort of have to be.

1110
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,083
And, and you know, the, the
author, Michael Stanley,

1111
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,918
who you mentioned is credited
on the screenplay here.

1112
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,379
You know, he gets to do stuff

1113
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,713
that the movie didn't
have the budget to do.

1114
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,800
Like there's an extended
sequence inside the vault.

1115
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,634
- [Dan] Yes!

1116
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,469
- [Rob] Where we see all
of the, the doohickeys

1117
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,346
and the this thing comes down.

1118
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,181
And then the, the what,
and they didn't, you know,

1119
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,516
they weren't gonna spend the money

1120
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,478
to build this massive, "Ocean's
Eleven" style bank vault-

1121
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,312
- [Dan] Yes.

1122
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,147
- [Rob] For this movie,
but in the, in the book,

1123
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,275
he can spend a couple of pages
where, you know, Ray Milland

1124
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,026
and Janssen are in there
and it's, you know,

1125
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,736
(mimics explosion) and
then you turn the wheel.

1126
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,571
- [Dan] Yes!

1127
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,405
- [Rob] And then this thing
comes down and stuff like that.

1128
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,240
Oh, here, we have to mention the-

1129
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,241
- [Dan] Yes!

1130
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,075
- [Rob] The Beach Boys song.

1131
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,909
(Rob and Dan laugh)

1132
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,245
- [Dan] So, so this is
"Sloop John B" in German.

1133
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,371
- [Rob] In German of, of course.

1134
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,247
- [Dan] Playing over here, yes.

1135
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,333
Playing because, yeah, Ms.
Abbott will come out in a moment.

1136
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,752
Denise Abbott, that's,
is that a German name?

1137
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,129
I mean, I was gonna say she doesn't look

1138
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,922
like Bud's daughter or anything.

1139
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,092
- [Rob] (laughs) You've
not heard the Beach Boys

1140
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,428
until you've enjoyed it
in the original German.

1141
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,346
- [Dan] She doesn't travel
around with like Betty Costello,

1142
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,891
getting into random fighting
monsters or anything like that.

1143
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,725
(Rob laughs)

1144
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,894
But, but yeah, this, so,

1145
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,271
so this is them meeting up
listening to some great music

1146
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,607
and she, she, I do like,
I do, I, I kind of,

1147
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,400
the thing I like about
Denise Abbott is she,

1148
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,195
she has this moment earlier
where she jokes over the phone,

1149
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,280
"Oh, there's plenty of parking."

1150
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,532
And it kind of falls,
it's kinda like a dud.

1151
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,993
But you could see she's like
a really attractive woman who

1152
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,704
has a nice sense of humor,
she just may be not too,

1153
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,040
she's like, she's like
just standing around.

1154
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,834
She's gorgeous, but she wants to be funny.

1155
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,378
She wants to do shtick, maybe
it is a Bud Abbott thing.

1156
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,379
I don't know, but, but,

1157
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,882
but, so like her, "There's
plenty of parking,"

1158
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,301
and, "I'll slip into
something less comfortable,"

1159
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,970
are, are kind of funny lines, you know,

1160
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:04,930
and it's, it's like there's a feeling

1161
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,224
where like if I hadn't been,

1162
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,184
in the movie, it's tough to
gauge exactly what she does.

1163
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,561
She seems to be a
professional black mailer.

1164
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,856
In the novelization, she's a
model, she's a famous model.

1165
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,192
- [Rob] Completely plausible.

1166
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:21,154
- [Dan] Yes, yes, and, and so, and, but,

1167
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,447
but there's, I get this feeling,

1168
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,491
like when you're watching her
and she delivers those lines,

1169
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,077
like, she's like, "This,
these looks are a burden,

1170
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,330
I wish I, I had a more,
more a "Diller" look to me

1171
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,415
so I could do more comedy."

1172
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,751
That's the feeling I get
sometimes, but that's just me.

1173
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,295
- [Dan] I, well, I find my great looks

1174
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,880
to be a hindrance sometimes, Dan.

1175
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,382
I admit that and I'm
willing to admit that here.

1176
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,801
- [Dan] Exactly, I actually
only have 80 minutes

1177
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,428
of Rob's time, so for 10
minutes of this commentary,

1178
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,055
I’ll be doing a Rob impersonation.

1179
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,015
- [Rob] (laughs) By the way, the knot

1180
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,310
on David Christopher's tie
is, is something to behold.

1181
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,854
(Rob and Dan laugh)

1182
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,689
- [Dan] It is.

1183
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,523
- [Rob] Look at that thing.

1184
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,357
- [Dan] I feel like his,

1185
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,984
I feel like his secretary
normally does his tie tying

1186
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,653
for him and the longer
he gets away from home,

1187
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,529
either he wears the-

1188
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,697
- [Rob] It loosens, yeah.

1189
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,284
- [Dan] It loose, (laughs)
now, now I was just going to,

1190
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,536
since we got them chatting
really briefly, I was just going

1191
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,539
to bring up Mr. Jack Arnold briefly.

1192
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,373
- [Rob] Oh, sure, yeah.

1193
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,207
- [Dan] I don't, I don't know that,

1194
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,585
so Jack Arnold was born
in 1916, died in 1992,

1195
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,630
and he was a director extraordinaire.

1196
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,843
To me, he's one of the main
names when you are referring

1197
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:28,596
to sort of the 50s' "Keep
Watching the Skies" genre

1198
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,391
of American Sci-Fi, because he did,

1199
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,434
"It Came from Outer Space",

1200
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,518
"Creature from the Black Lagoon",

1201
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,437
"Revenge of the Creature", "Tarantula",

1202
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,272
"The Incredible Shrinking Man".

1203
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,191
That's enough, those are,
those are all, all huge.

1204
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,610
He also did "The Space Children"

1205
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,114
and "Monster on the Campus",
which maybe aren't as big,

1206
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,699
but have their charms.

1207
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,951
And he, he did "High School Confidential".

1208
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,661
He did "The Mouse That Roared"

1209
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,079
over in England with Peter Sellers.

1210
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,122
- [Rob] Peter Sellers, sure.

1211
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:59,002
- [Dan] Yes, he did a
whole bunch of film noir.

1212
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,296
He did, he did episodes of a show called,

1213
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,048
I believe it was called
"Dusty's Trail", which

1214
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,593
became a movie called "The
Wackiest Wagon in the West",

1215
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,262
which this same year, 1976,

1216
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,014
that this movie came out in Europe,

1217
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,515
"The Wacky", "Dusty's Trail",

1218
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,351
they took four episodes of this sitcom,

1219
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,393
which was a Sherwood Schwartz,

1220
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,937
basically "Gilligan’s
Island" on a wagon train,

1221
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:18,772
(Rob laughs)

1222
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,357
and edited four episodes together,

1223
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,901
took out the laugh track, and
released it as a theatrical.

1224
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,235
- [Rob] Wow (laughs).

1225
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,405
- [Dan] So technically his
last theatricals were this

1226
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,158
and a couple episodes of that sitcom,

1227
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,868
which ain't the greatest.

1228
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,204
- [Rob] Wow, well this,
this was gonna fit perfectly

1229
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,622
for my fade out show then,

1230
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,499
if this is his final theatrical film.

1231
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,917
- [Dan] Oh, yes, yes, exactly.

1232
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,669
So, and, and he did lots of TV.

1233
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,255
He did tons of TV, he
was doing like a love,

1234
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,217
"Love Boat", he did,
he did like 1 5 episodes

1235
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:51,137
of "The Brady Bunch",
which is interesting.

1236
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,222
I don't know what episodes he did.

1237
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,183
I, I wish I'd love to do maybe
a Jack Arnold marathon over,

1238
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,185
over an, an afternoon.

1239
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,187
He did lots, he did "McLeod",
"Love, American Style",

1240
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,315
the Virginian "Mod Squad",
lots of "Gilligan's Island".

1241
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,235
He did "Sheriff Lobo", he did
a couple of "Ellery Queens".

1242
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,530
He did a "Buck Rogers
in the 25th Century".

1243
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,739
He did a lot of stuff.

1244
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,699
He was like, he was, it's, I, I like him

1245
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,619
because he's not like a
really dynamic director,

1246
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,496
but the camera's always in the right spot.

1247
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,832
We always, well, maybe in
this one we don't always know

1248
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,251
what's going on, but we
generally always feel like

1249
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,877
we're supposed to know what's going on.

1250
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,587
That's the thing with
"The Swiss Conspiracy"

1251
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,964
is you don't always know what's going on,

1252
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,674
but the film carries you along.

1253
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,260
Maybe it doesn't matter in the end.

1254
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,638
- [Rob] I, I always feel
like if any director

1255
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,974
has one really great movie, right,

1256
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,267
that's great enough, right?

1257
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,101
- [Dan] Yes.

1258
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:38,977
- [Rob] But, but then you think
maybe they got lucky, right?

1259
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:42,021
Maybe they got lucky,
but when they get two,

1260
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,607
I'm like, "Then it's
them, then it's them."

1261
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,067
And any, any director who can say,

1262
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,777
"I have 'Creature of the Black Lagoon'

1263
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,195
and 'The Incredible Shrinking Man',

1264
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,781
just those two on my res-"

1265
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,284
Besides all the ones you
already just mentioned,

1266
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,744
that, you're like,
"That's a solid career".

1267
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,996
That's an amazingly solid career.

1268
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,164
- [Dan] Yes, you, you won.

1269
00:40:59,248 --> 00:40:59,998
Yeah, you got it, you got it.

1270
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,249
You were doing the right
thing, yeah, exactly.

1271
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,083
- [Rob] You did, maybe, right.

1272
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,334
Maybe you were a
journeyman, but who cares?

1273
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,794
You were, you were the right journeyman

1274
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,712
at the right time, you know?

1275
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,921
- [Dan] Yes, exactly.

1276
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:07,797
- [Rob] Oh, no.

1277
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,631
- [Dan] Oh, dear.

1278
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,466
- [Rob] John Saxon, this is, this is,

1279
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,509
this is a show wrap for-

1280
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,344
- [Dan] Yeah, for Mr., Mr. Saxon there.

1281
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,054
And it's, it's, it's, it's interesting,

1282
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,391
and, and, and I, I, I’ll, this
will be the last time I refer

1283
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,311
to it, but when the, we
do see the assassins going

1284
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:26,024
after our David, I am
going to mention the,

1285
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:29,527
the strangeness of the, the,
the hit men who are supposed

1286
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,155
to be sort of undercover,
doing this casually,

1287
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,950
killing a guy and then stuffing
him in the fake rented car

1288
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,077
of an ex Department of Justice guy

1289
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,621
who's investigating blackmail

1290
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,331
in one of the biggest Swiss banks.

1291
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,165
(phone rings)

1292
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,416
Seems a bit of a drawing attention

1293
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,376
to yourself kind of thing.

1294
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,836
- [Rob] I always wondered if like,

1295
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,047
companies want their name associated

1296
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,633
with things when it's nefarious stuff.

1297
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,592
- [Dan] Oh, yes, yes!

1298
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,426
- [Rob] You know, like Hertz Car Rental,

1299
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,844
do they want their name in a movie

1300
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,263
where it's people getting,
bodies get dumped in trunks?

1301
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,640
You know, they don't want that.

1302
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,434
- [Dan] May, maybe they had
like a thing where like, if,

1303
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,605
if you rent from LAX on
this day, open your trunk,

1304
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,233
John Saxon might be inside, and if he is-

1305
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,318
- [Rob] That'd be, that
would’ve been amazing.

1306
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,152
That would've been a-

1307
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:11,986
- [Dan] You'd win a free autographed copy

1308
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,031
of the novelization of
"The Swiss Conspiracy".

1309
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,200
- [Rob] (laughs) "Swiss
Conspiracy", would've been great.

1310
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,243
- [Dan] That would’ve been fantastic.

1311
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,328
So here's the second and
final scene with Corinne,

1312
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,121
who seems like he, sh-,
she should be doing more.

1313
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,373
This is one of those weird things

1314
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,167
that makes me think maybe the
film should have been longer

1315
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,877
and maybe they kept it around 90 minutes

1316
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,588
because "French Connection"
was around 90 minutes.

1317
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,674
And because she feels like she should be

1318
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,008
in it more, right?

1319
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:34,842
- [Rob] Because she, she has,

1320
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:35,885
she probably has a much larger role

1321
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,679
in the David Christopher
TV series in my head.

1322
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,430
- [Dan] Yes, exactly, exactly, and there,

1323
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,765
there is, I think it's,

1324
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,142
if you, I think it's, if you
watch the previous scene,

1325
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,310
I think it's into this scene.

1326
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,188
When you see Hayes's body
in the, in the trunk,

1327
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,899
the music starts to go
(mimics ominous music)

1328
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,235
and then it cuts out when it cuts to her.

1329
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,820
Like there's a bad, like
if you listen to it,

1330
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,113
it's either this scene
or the previous one.

1331
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,072
But I think it's this one.

1332
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,199
If you listen to the music
closely, put headphones on

1333
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,494
and listen to the, there's
a kind of a bad sound edit

1334
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,829
when it cuts to her.

1335
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,080
- [Rob] Oh, I didn't
even notice that, okay.

1336
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,498
- [Dan] Almost, almost like are they,

1337
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,208
did they cut her scene short

1338
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,376
or did they, I mean,

1339
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,503
did they have a scene where he's in jail?

1340
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,297
'Cause he said he spends the night in jail

1341
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,591
and they, they dismissed
that Hertz Rent A Car thing

1342
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,883
so quickly, I mean, it's gone now.

1343
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,802
It's done now, it'll never
be referred to again.

1344
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,928
- [Rob] Yep.

1345
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:19,762
- [Dan] So I'm, I'm wondering if

1346
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,056
that was a scene maybe
that got cut out, I don't.

1347
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:22,890
- [Rob] Oh, interesting.

1348
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:23,850
- [Dan] I don't know, but we're about

1349
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,060
to meet the great John Ireland.

1350
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,604
- [Rob] Yeah, we're gonna
meet one of our, yeah,

1351
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,064
one of our, one of our
sus-, well, not our sus-,

1352
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,025
we will later, learn later he's a suspect,

1353
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,985
but right now he's a victim.

1354
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,321
But yes, John Ireland,
this is his longest scene.

1355
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,531
So let me, let me briefly, we'll just talk

1356
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,117
about his credits, he passed away in 1992.

1357
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,328
You know, an amazing list of credits,

1358
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,247
"All the King's Men",
"Spartacus", "Red River",

1359
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,376
"Farewell, My Lovely", "Raw
Deal", "My Darling, Clementine".

1360
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,210
- [Dan] Yes.

1361
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,462
- [Rob] "Satan's Cheerleaders", which,

1362
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,881
when am I gonna get to say
those two movies back to back?

1363
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,716
"Gun Slinger", "The Incubus",

1364
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,636
I mean, just, you know, and
he's, he's realty great here

1365
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,179
as this kind of, first of all,

1366
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,390
he's acting like he's 50 years
older than David Christopher,

1367
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,267
and he's like 9, you know,

1368
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,394
because they're kind
of not that far apart.

1369
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,395
But he's a, "My boy."

1370
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,772
Like he's definitely, you know, the,

1371
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,441
the, the, the Texas oil
man, this kind of thing.

1372
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,943
I'm surprised they don't
have him in a 10 gallon hat.

1373
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,528
- [Dan] Yeah, with big hat,
like a J. R. Ewing hat, right?

1374
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,322
- [Rob] Yeah, exactly,
but again, he's indoors

1375
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,740
and he's, he's a gentleman

1376
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,200
and you don't wear your hat indoors.

1377
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,409
So that's what it, but look at him,

1378
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,662
he's drinking the whiskey
straight outta the bottle.

1379
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,579
- [Dan] That he brought himself, yeah.

1380
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,997
- [Rob] (laughs) That he
brought, brought himself.

1381
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,624
You know, this is great, yeah.

1382
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,833
- [Dan] That's a, yeah,
that's a big thing,

1383
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,544
in the novelization, I think
McGowan and Hayes are like

1384
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,338
on the same plane

1385
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,924
and McGowan is watching
Hayes at one point.

1386
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,300
Which is funny because,
if you think about it,

1387
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,720
like McGowan's watching Hayes,
the cop is watching Hayes,

1388
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,389
the assassins are watching Hayes.

1389
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,849
Everybody's watching Hayes,
but now what do they do?

1390
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,809
Hayes is, Hayes is dead,

1391
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,645
I mean, they're all, I
guess they're probably all

1392
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,064
in this restaurant watching
each other, I would bet.

1393
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,524
- [Rob] (laughs) Right, exactly.

1394
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:58,069
Half this restaurant's
lunch rush is spies.

1395
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:58,945
- [Dan] Exact, spies.

1396
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,530
(Rob laughs)

1397
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,490
- [Rob] And they're, and they're
all ordering the minimum,

1398
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,534
you know, because they're
just there to, for appearance.

1399
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,703
- [Dan] You can tell, "Did
you bring your own booze?

1400
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,870
Okay, put 'em over here."

1401
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,664
- [Rob] "I'll just have an appetizer."

1402
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,748
I mean, well, that's not.

1403
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,709
- [Dan] I'll just, just,
"No, I don't want whiskey,

1404
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,127
bring me nachos."

1405
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,336
(Rob laughs)

1406
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,797
"Light on the jalapenos 'cause ugh."

1407
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,841
- [Rob] (laughs) I love
his eyebrows, by the way.

1408
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,217
John Ireland's eyebrow are,

1409
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,512
are really Donald
Moffitt, Andy Rudy level.

1410
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,849
- [Dan] Yes, he's got those,
those wonderful crazy,

1411
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,392
those wonderful crazy eyebrows.

1412
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,935
And there's, and, and the, the,

1413
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,104
the conversation they're
having it, it's one

1414
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,230
of those interesting conversations

1415
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,065
where it's all very important,

1416
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,192
but in between the calling him "boy"

1417
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,027
and watching him pour the whiskey

1418
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,946
and watching David
Janssen drinking his beer,

1419
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,614
you can kind of miss what they're saying,

1420
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,160
which is basically that McGowan
is having big tax troubles.

1421
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,037
- [Rob] Yep, yep, oh, here
we go, there's Elke Sommer.

1422
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,039
- [Dan] And she's back, and we're, again,

1423
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,584
we're knee deep in, "Is
everything all set?"

1424
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,335
"Yes, everything's all set."

1425
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:01,132
And very shortly we're about
to get the big demand from the,

1426
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,467
the, from the blackmailers.

1427
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,426
- [Rob] I wanna mention this just

1428
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,011
'cause Elke Sommer doesn't
have a lot of scenes

1429
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:08,639
in this movie, she is credited
at the top as guest star.

1430
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,474
- [Dan] Yes!

1431
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,642
- [Rob] Right, I will die on this hill.

1432
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,644
You cannot have a guest star in a movie.

1433
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,689
Movies, all movies' cast are one-offs.

1434
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:17,523
- [Dan] Yes, exactly.

1435
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,316
- [Rob] Cannot have a guest,

1436
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,692
this is not "The Love Boat".

1437
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,526
- [Dan] Yes, exactly.

1438
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,529
- [Rob] There, Elke Sommer is
a cast member in this movie.

1439
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,572
She's not a guest star.

1440
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,199
I know that with her agent

1441
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,492
and got her special billing.

1442
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,328
And I get it, oh, here's another
way of delivering the mail.

1443
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,871
But that's every time I see "guest star"

1444
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,247
in a movie, like that's not a thing!

1445
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,624
- [Dan] That doesn't make, yeah, exactly.

1446
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,458
That always confu-, and oh,

1447
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,210
and here are those two
guys, you'll see 'em.

1448
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,711
- [Rob] They're right there (laughs).

1449
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,463
- [Dan] There are two guys
right there, come on, really?

1450
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,465
- [Rob] We all know guys like
that in our office, right?

1451
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,884
- [Rob] Yeah, you, you realty
didn't see the person walk up

1452
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,552
and drop the, drop the thing right there?

1453
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,512
- [Rob] Right in the middle of the floor.

1454
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,429
Right in the middle of the floor,

1455
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,473
not even on a table, you know?

1456
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,809
- [Dan] Exactly, I mean,
that guard is very focused

1457
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,143
on whatever it is he's looking at.

1458
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,522
In, in the novelization he's
thinking about bratwurst.

1459
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,148
(Rob laughs)

1460
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,983
The, the book actually
opens with two pages

1461
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,860
of him talking about how
much he loves 'wurst,

1462
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,404
bratwurst and sausages,
and when I say sausage,

1463
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,615
I'm not being coy, I'm
talking about actual sausages.

1464
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,783
- [Rob] No, literally, yeah, no, there's,

1465
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,617
there's a lot of food-

1466
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,451
- [Dan] Literally sausages.

1467
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,285
- [Rob] A lot of food
porn in the, the novel.

1468
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,370
- [Dan] Yes, and a lot of-

1469
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,621
- [Rob] Among other porn.

1470
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,956
(Rob and Dan laugh)

1471
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,250
- [Dan] Now, now this
introduces us to Kosta,

1472
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,043
the guy from Amsterdam.

1473
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,754
- [Rob] Yes, this is Curt Lowens,

1474
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,548
great character director, Curt Lowens.

1475
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,924
- [Dan] And it, and it's
interesting here, when you, again,

1476
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,385
when you watch this a second time, you,

1477
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:31,597
we are reading the final
demand from the blackmailers,

1478
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,599
1 million from each of the five people,

1479
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,687
10 million from the bank,
follow these instructions.

1480
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:41,649
So this is the, so af-, from
this point on, we're waiting,

1481
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,944
I think it's like two days from
now they're going to do the,

1482
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,487
the climax is going to occur.

1483
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,947
So we're getting that
information here halfway

1484
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,323
into the movie and it's interesting

1485
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,158
that the Kosta character,

1486
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,910
from what we know about
him later in the movie,

1487
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,997
shows up at this point when
it seems to be a lost cause.

1488
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:56,831
- [Rob] Mmhmm.

1489
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,499
You know, when it's like,
"Oh, well, Christopher,"

1490
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,960
but has Christopher really
done much investigating?

1491
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,295
- [Rob] Right!

1492
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,171
- [Dan] He talked with a
half drunk John Ireland,

1493
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,133
I mean, McGowan for, for like two minutes.

1494
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,595
And he flirted with, he
flirted with Denise Abbott.

1495
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,805
But has he actually
done any investigating?

1496
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,724
- [Rob] Right, and he, I mean
he fought off John Saxon,

1497
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,267
but that, that he didn't,
he didn't start that.

1498
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,394
He, he got himself out of it.

1499
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,521
- [Dan] And that's, I mean,
that's a special brand

1500
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,982
of investigation, like automatic getting

1501
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,110
in brawls over and over again,
but it, but it's interesting-

1502
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:26,944
- [Rob] You know he's relaxed here

1503
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,613
'cause he's got no tie now,
now he's open-shirting it

1504
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,907
with the chest hair, very
manly, very, very manly.

1505
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,325
- [Dan] And Ko-, and Kosta, I,

1506
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,535
I think Kosta dropped the letter.

1507
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,370
I think that makes sense.

1508
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,413
Who dropped the first letter?

1509
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,541
I can't say, because if you think about,

1510
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,460
if you think about who
the blackmailers are,

1511
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,586
they must have hired someone

1512
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,795
to drop the first letter.

1513
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,506
Because if you think about
it, Rasher's dead, McGowan

1514
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:51,093
and Hayes are arriving, Kosta,
unless he's actually in town

1515
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,845
and lying, isn't there yet.

1516
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,348
But he, I wouldn't think
he'd wanna be in town

1517
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,767
and get seen accidentally,
because that would be suspicious.

1518
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,268
And Denise Abbott isn't there yet.

1519
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,646
So who dropped the first letter?

1520
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,939
- [Rob] Well, all right, we can, we,

1521
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,691
we'll argue about this on
our second commentary track

1522
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,486
which you can access on
the special hidden menu.

1523
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,695
- [Dan] Yes, exact, exactly.

1524
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,489
- [Rob] (laughs) I mean, but
he's like a big roller though.

1525
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,116
Wouldn't people notice
him walking into the bank

1526
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,035
and leave, dropping a letter on the floor?

1527
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,036
- [Dan] Yeah, that's, that's the thing.

1528
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,163
Like, maybe he did
something where he said,

1529
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,081
he like pointed something.

1530
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,332
He said, "Guard, I think

1531
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,084
that person's doing something illegal."

1532
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,210
- [Rob] "Look over there."

1533
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,044
- [Dan] And, you know, he's just,

1534
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,254
he's just thinking, "Wurst, wurst,

1535
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,923
oh, I'll look over to the left."

1536
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,175
Drop, "Sir, we're okay."

1537
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,134
And he knows those two guys

1538
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,552
at the desk ain't gonna be looking at him.

1539
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,845
- [Rob] (laughs) That's
true, those guys, yeah,

1540
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,222
those guys are, those are-

1541
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,099
- [Dan] So we met Kosta and Kosta's great

1542
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,518
because he doesn't do
much and he doesn't care.

1543
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,521
And so, and so he, I,

1544
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:46,190
and I don't know whether that
makes him instantly suspicious

1545
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,067
that he shows up right at this point,

1546
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,069
or just not suspicious at all.

1547
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,531
In the end we'll go with the
former, but I can't really,

1548
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,199
I couldn't really tell
when it first happened

1549
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,826
because he's so dismissive.

1550
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,953
"Just pay the money, I don't care.

1551
00:49:59,037 --> 00:49:59,829
Why do you care?

1552
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,998
Just pay the money,
I'm going, I'm leaving.

1553
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,416
Just pay the money," okay, okay.

1554
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,918
- [Rob] Oh, now here we go, here we go.

1555
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:06,752
- [Dan] This is interesting, yes.

1556
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,962
- [Rob] I love this car chase.

1557
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,089
'Cause it's not a chase, it's a,

1558
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,175
it's foreplay, you know,
as we'll learn in a minute.

1559
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,218
But this is great.

1560
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,929
This is, and, I mean,
look how fast he's going.

1561
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:17,763
I mean, I know they're probably

1562
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,849
under cranking it a little, but he realty-

1563
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,809
- [Dan] It looks pretty
good though, if they are.

1564
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,185
- [Rob] It looks pretty good.

1565
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,354
Like they're really going fast

1566
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,732
and they're going around
these hairpin turns

1567
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,025
and they're gonna go
through, there's, look at it,

1568
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,485
look, look how happy, look
at that, he's just great.

1569
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,862
- [Dan] You don't, you
don't see him smile,

1570
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,530
like in "Harry O", you
don't see him smile.

1571
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,742
There is, there is a, there's
a Bob Hope special he's in,

1572
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,578
which I might mention in a
minute, where he smiles a lot

1573
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,121
and it's kind of distracting.

1574
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,331
- [Rob] (laughs) It's, "What's wrong?

1575
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,624
Why is David Janssen smiling

1576
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,917
or something upsetting, this is-"

1577
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,335
- [Dan] But like you said, this is, yeah,

1578
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,712
this is very much like a foreplay.

1579
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,756
And it might end with, you know,

1580
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,674
when he goes off the cliff near the end.

1581
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,508
I don't know if that's meant

1582
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,886
to be something suggestive, I'm not sure.

1583
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:57,720
- [Rob] (laughs) Subtext.

1584
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:58,929
- [Dan] I'm not sure,
that's not my, you know,

1585
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,347
but I love the fact that like,

1586
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,516
we're now we're in "On Her
Majesty's Secret Service".

1587
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,392
What's going on here?

1588
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,186
You know, I, like, like it's a mix

1589
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,439
of like the chase from
"Goldfinger" when he's in,

1590
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,566
in Switzerland and then like going

1591
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,693
through like "On Her Majesty's
Secret Service" stuff.

1592
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,403
And they got these great tunnels,

1593
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,404
look at this, they're great!

1594
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,198
- [Rob] Oh, the lights go down, oh,

1595
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,032
how cool is that, look at that.

1596
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,826
- [Dan] And it's, and the
great thing is this is, like,

1597
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,660
like I said at the beginning,

1598
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,079
this is the opposite
of the opening credits.

1599
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,457
Takes us from the gorgeous
Alps, which are Swiss,

1600
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,794
to banks, where they,
which they have everywhere.

1601
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:33,631
And this, this scene starts
in a crappy little parking lot

1602
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,091
where you, where you first think,

1603
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,217
is one of them going the wrong way?

1604
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,052
And now look at how gorgeous it is!

1605
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,386
- [Rob] Look at, they're
g-, they're driving the,

1606
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,305
the road is wet, look at that.

1607
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,016
They're really, these stunt
drivers are doing this, this is-

1608
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,477
- [Rob] Are they, and it's pretty funny.

1609
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,062
And it's weird because like,

1610
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,648
in the same way that the
big action scene earlier

1611
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,651
on didn't involve our leading man,

1612
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,444
which is slightly strange,

1613
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,364
this scene here, which is another
kind of cool action scene,

1614
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,741
is really just like you said, foreplay.

1615
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,910
- [Rob] Oh, here we go,
oh, this is trouble.

1616
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:03,828
- [Rob] And you do wonder when you get

1617
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:04,703
to the end of the movie,

1618
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,288
did she know this was there?

1619
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,289
(car screeches)

1620
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,835
- [Rob] Yeah, whoa, oh, look
at that, oh, that's great!

1621
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:11,836
- [Dan] Oh no!

1622
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,964
- [Rob] look at this, I mean,
I love how relaxed he is too.

1623
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,550
Like, his car is teetering off the edge.

1624
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,385
And look at him, I mean,
he's just kinda like,

1625
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,469
"All right, well this is a problem."

1626
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,429
Like, he doesn't even
look like, look at him!

1627
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,431
- [Dan] Yes, it's like,
"I don't want to move."

1628
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,933
(Rob gasps)

1629
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:28,018
- [Rob] This is, this is-

1630
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,145
- [Dan] It's, it's real-,
and the camera panned over

1631
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,438
to there, so they got it,
they got it set up nicely.

1632
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:35,234
So it is actually like,
he's actually there.

1633
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,819
- [Rob] Look how casually
he gets outta that car!

1634
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,947
- [Dan] Yes, and I, I,
I, and I will be honest,

1635
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:42,449
I was actually very glad that
they didn't show his car go

1636
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,993
down the hill and explode
and stuff, I was very glad.

1637
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,703
- [Rob] No, it's fine, you don't need it.

1638
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:46,537
- [Dan] We’ll see him next up.

1639
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:47,371
- [Rob] And there we are.

1640
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,205
- [Dan] And here we go.

1641
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,124
Now I, I'm gonna say,
I, I think right here,

1642
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,167
maybe we should talk about one

1643
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,710
or two of the actors while they're,

1644
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,003
to give them their privacy.

1645
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,547
But I will say this, this scene
is about three minutes long

1646
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,090
and it's just one shot just like this,

1647
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,968
which I think is pretty
brave for theatrical

1648
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,429
to just let the two actors talk like this.

1649
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,805
- [Rob] I agree, now, before I get

1650
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,890
to the those credits though,

1651
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,142
I do wanna read a passage from the novel.

1652
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,685
- [Dan] Yes, please, I'm sitting back,

1653
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,729
I'm muting myself, I'm outta here.

1654
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,272
- [Rob] This, (laughs) this book

1655
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,024
gets very explicit, everybody.

1656
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,193
So I'm not gonna read those passages

1657
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,196
'cause we want to keep this
commentary safe for work.

1658
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,531
But I will, I will read
the part that it sort

1659
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:27,161
of just follows some very
explicit sexual references.

1660
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,371
So it's, because it, it
happens right as this scene,

1661
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,750
David thought of his car and
the winding hairpin turns

1662
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,669
and the surge of power
when he demanded speed

1663
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,380
and held himself strong with her writhing,

1664
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,050
it turned to a sobbing,
moaning, shuttering effusion

1665
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,385
of delight underneath him.

1666
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,762
Then without breaking their union,

1667
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,598
he lowered himself onto the
bed, lifting up her legs

1668
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,892
to follow him until they
were both comfortable.

1669
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,645
Gradually he moved, he moved faster

1670
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,898
until his own tension increased
to the point of explosion.

1671
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,776
And he rolled over on his back
and she was straddling him.

1672
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,111
Only then did he give
into the ultimate ecstasy

1673
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,613
that left every part of his body,

1674
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,531
except his thrusting penis,

1675
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,243
locked in a rigidity that was steel-like

1676
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,829
and growl his satisfaction
from the depths of his being.

1677
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,539
So there you go.

1678
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,916
- [Dan] Well, when, when you're
selling the novelizations

1679
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,253
on the checkout counters
next to "National Enquirer",

1680
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,213
you gotta pull people in.

1681
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,464
- [Rob] Woo, Michael Stanley!

1682
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,840
- [Dan] Yeah, woo Mike!

1683
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,468
Ooh, and that happens a bunch in the book.

1684
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,427
- [Rob] Oh, a lot, it happens a lot.

1685
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,262
- [Dan] That's not one off.

1686
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,388
- [Rob] That was the
most pa-, that was the,

1687
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,724
that was the most g-rated one I could find

1688
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,101
of the passages, yeah, wow.

1689
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,853
- [Dan] Exactly, yeah, it's
a heck of a novelization.

1690
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,688
- [Rob] It is.

1691
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,730
- [Dan] Everybody, so I just,
I'm just gonna talk about,

1692
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,649
we've already kind of
talked about David Janssen.

1693
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,483
- [Rob] A little bit.

1694
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,317
- [Dan] But he was born in '31 ,

1695
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,195
he died in 1980, sadly very young.

1696
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,738
His first big thing was "Richard Diamond,

1697
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,615
Private Detective", which is based off

1698
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,326
of a wonderful radio show
created by Blake Edwards.

1699
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,577
I've never seen the TV show,

1700
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,621
again, saving it for retirement.

1701
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,666
He's probably best known in
pop culture for "The Fugitive",

1702
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,209
which ran for four seasons

1703
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,087
and was one of the first shows
that had a proper finale.

1704
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,672
Nowadays, we get them all the time,

1705
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,258
unless streaming services
cancel your shows early

1706
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,093
and then leave you hanging for eternity.

1707
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,637
But back then you didn't
really get finales

1708
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,097
and "The Fugitive" is one of those.

1709
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:13,475
He was also on a show called
"O'Hara, U.S. Treasury".

1710
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,103
I've never seen it, I do a
podcast on short lived TV shows,

1711
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,896
so I may cover that one
day, if I can find it.

1712
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,107
Of course he was in
"Harry O", he was in a lot

1713
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,526
of movies, including the great "Dondi".

1714
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,695
- [Rob] Oh, boy.

1715
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:28,073
- [Dan] (laughs) Which
is in, which is listed

1716
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,243
in the Medved's "Fifty
Worst Films Of All Time".

1717
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,621
He's also, he was in "Maroon",
"Two-Minute Warning",

1718
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:38,417
"Covert Action", he was in
"Inchon", which is kind of a-

1719
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,251
- [Rob] Final film.

1720
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,588
- [Dan] Yes, yes, a notorious
film for being a huge,

1721
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,257
huge bomb, I've never
seen it, maybe one day.

1722
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,051
- [Dan] Paying the
actors in cash and stuff.

1723
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,677
There was a lot of ads, like (laughs).

1724
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,511
- [Dan] Yes, yes, he was.

1725
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,347
And he was in lots of, he was in a bunch

1726
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,474
of TV movies, "Mayday at 40,000 Feet!",

1727
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,476
"Stalk the Wild Child", "Fer de Lance",

1728
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,853
"Superdome", "Moon of the Wolf",

1729
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,688
which he plays a Louisiana sheriff,

1730
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,191
I did the co-, co-did the commentary

1731
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,609
for the Blu-ray of that,

1732
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,028
'cause I love that film
and he's fantastic in it.

1733
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,821
But that, yeah, that's
David Janssen and I,

1734
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,199
and now we're getting some more.

1735
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,200
- [Rob] I do wanna mention one thing

1736
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,284
about David Janssen than I read.

1737
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,118
- [Dan] Yes!

1738
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,828
- [Rob] Which, he passed
away at 49, which is tragic.

1739
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,705
I mean, that's incredibly young.

1740
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,793
But his pallbearers at
his funeral included

1741
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:25,881
Rod Stewart, Gregory Peck,
Milton Berle, Gene Kelly,

1742
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:30,219
and Richard Harris, I mean,
that is a life well lived

1743
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,303
when those are your pallbearers.

1744
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,180
- [Dan] You did it, yeah, wow.

1745
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,515
That was well done, sir, yeah, they, and-

1746
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,725
- [Rob] What do Rod Stewart
and Milton Berle have to talk?

1747
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,559
Well, I guess I could figure

1748
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,228
out what they had to talk
about, you know, still.

1749
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,062
(Dan laughs)

1750
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,313
That's amazing, what, what
a group, what a group.

1751
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,689
- [Dan] Yeah, that's Michael S-.

1752
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,191
Yeah, that's a Michael Stanley book

1753
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,526
that never got written, yeah.

1754
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,777
(Rob laughs)

1755
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,113
The, and, and the one last thing with Da-,

1756
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,823
David Janssen is that he's,

1757
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,074
he was in a Bob Hope special

1758
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,660
around this time, a 90
Minute special called "Joys",

1759
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,495
which is a takeoff on "Jaws",

1760
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,748
which is a really weird murder mystery.

1761
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,582
- [Rob] I've gotta see that.

1762
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,417
- [Dan] I think you can,

1763
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,127
you can watch it online
if you've never seen it.

1764
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:08,173
Bob Hope, "Joys", it's 1975,
1976, '77, it's really weird.

1765
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:11,927
- [Rob] Yeah, I gotta check that out.

1766
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,178
How have I not seen that to this point?

1767
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,097
- Yeah, it's really weird.

1768
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,473
But, but yeah, so that's that.

1769
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,810
So now we're doing,
we're, we're beginning to,

1770
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,980
what I call, sort of
close off the red herrings

1771
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,481
that happened in the movie.

1772
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:29,361
And I'm gonna talk about Elke
Sommer just real quick here.

1773
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,321
Maybe I won't, sit back, everyone,

1774
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,698
I'm gonna give you 10
minutes of Elke Sommer.

1775
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,199
No, we don't have time.

1776
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,076
Elke Sommer was born in 1940.

1777
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,829
She is, as far as I know,
she's still alive and,

1778
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:43,083
and fingers crossed, alive
and well, she is German

1779
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:46,128
and her first big role was the wonderful,

1780
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,171
bringing up Blake Edwards again,

1781
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:51,383
"Shot in the Dark", which
is a absolutely joy-,

1782
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,719
joyous film, the second in
the "Pink Panther" series,

1783
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:57,931
possibly the best, po-, I,
I would say the best made

1784
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,058
of the films in the "Pink Panther" series.

1785
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,268
She was in the Bob Hope film,

1786
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,020
"Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number!"

1787
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,856
Again, also in the "Fifty
Worst Films of All Time" book

1788
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,901
by the Medveds, she was
in a "Carry On" film,

1789
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:12,613
which I wrote, I wanna say
it's "Carry On Behind".

1790
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,490
But my last word is scribbled here.

1791
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,950
So it's "Carry On",
something beginning with B.

1792
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,827
She was in a version of
"Then There Were None".

1793
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,079
She was in the great film, "The Oscar",

1794
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,790
well, I say great film,
you should watch it.

1795
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,667
She was in two Mario Bava
films, "Baron Blood",

1796
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,211
"Lisa and the Devil", she was

1797
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,255
in two fun "James Bond" ripoffs,
"Deadlier Than the Male",

1798
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,425
which I believe was a
Bulldog Drummond thing.

1799
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,135
And one of Ray Milland's earliest films

1800
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,387
was a really fun Bulldog Drummond film.

1801
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,972
And she was in "The
Wrecking Crew", which is one

1802
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,475
of the Dean Martin, Matt Helm films.

1803
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,559
And she was just in a touch, she was also

1804
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,102
on "I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses",

1805
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,855
which is a "Video Nasties" adjacent film.

1806
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,732
And she was in a lot of stuff.

1807
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,193
And she's just one of, every
time, she shows up in a lot

1808
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,861
of things around this time,
and every time you see her,

1809
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,614
she's in, she's in a TV
movie called "Probe",

1810
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,741
which is a precursor to
a show called "Search",

1811
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,660
which I love, she's great in that.

1812
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,371
And that, and "Search"
actually had an episode

1813
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,914
that involved a Swiss bank account

1814
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,916
and people being blackmailed.

1815
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,209
- [Rob] Oh, hey, okay.

1816
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,835
- [Dan] That was made about
four years before this.

1817
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,836
Instead of David Janssen,

1818
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,214
you get Doug McClure, which is awesome.

1819
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,507
- [Rob] (laughs) Okay, sure.

1820
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,510
- [Dan] And Doug McClure, and,
and in that one they actually

1821
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,220
go into the vaults

1822
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,181
and into the computers and
such of the Swiss bank to,

1823
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,393
and they're those huge 70s,
60s style computers, folks.

1824
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,978
And they do go into the
vaults and the banks

1825
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,187
and they sort of, they,

1826
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:31,024
they do more intensive research
than Mr. Christopher seems

1827
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,192
to do, which is just kind

1828
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,194
of talking people and
following people around.

1829
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,905
- [Rob] (laughs) And run on highways.

1830
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:41,493
- [Dan] Yes, fantastic, so
I, I feel like I should talk

1831
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,287
about, would you mind if I just

1832
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,746
mention Anton Differing real quick?

1833
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:45,581
- [Rob] Of course not, yeah, sure.

1834
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:46,707
- [Dan] Again, I keep saying
I don't, why I keep saying,

1835
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,377
"Real quick," but he was born in 191 6.

1836
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:53,338
He died in either '88 or '89.

1837
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,881
I can't tell what I wrote down here.

1838
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:58,885
It's a nine or an eight,
he died soon after 1988.

1839
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,805
And he played, he was German
also, he played lots of Nazis.

1840
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,557
He was in "The Man Who Could Cheat Death".

1841
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,226
He was in "Fahrenheit
451 ", "Where Eagles Dare",

1842
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,562
"The Colditz Story", "I Am a Camera".

1843
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:11,231
He was in the great "Mark of the Devil 2".

1844
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,317
He was in a couple of giallos,

1845
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,526
"Iguana With a Tongue of Fire",

1846
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,194
"Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye",

1847
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,863
He was in a "Nunsploitation" film,

1848
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,698
"Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun".

1849
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:24,369
He was in "The Beast of Must
Die", a fun werewolf film.

1850
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:28,081
He was in "Victory", the
Sylvester Stallone, Pelé film.

1851
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,791
He was in "The Winds
of War", TV miniseries,

1852
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,293
Jess Franco's "Faceless",

1853
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,920
and Jerry Lewis' "The
Day the Clown Cried".

1854
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,340
- [Rob] Oh, by the way,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1855
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,175
but this, that scene there
with the line down the,

1856
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,843
it looked like they were
in two different scenes

1857
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,511
that were split together even
though they're not (laughs).

1858
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,263
- [Dan] Yes, it did, that
was a little weird, yeah.

1859
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,307
- [Rob] (laughs) It's like all
of a sudden there's like a,

1860
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,683
why was Brian Bromell brought in

1861
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,686
to do a split diopter shock
for this, for this movie?

1862
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,147
- [Dan] Yeah, it's exactly,
yeah, that was a little weird.

1863
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,607
So right now we're kind of, we're kind

1864
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,816
of tearing towards the end

1865
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:58,445
and we're getting, we're, we're
getting, we are getting the,

1866
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,072
we're gonna finally resolve
what's going on with Benninger.

1867
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,824
And it looks like our
assassins are still there.

1868
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,117
And oh, the, by the way,

1869
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,078
the final thing Anton Differing did

1870
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:09,039
was a three-part "Dr Who" story in 1988,

1871
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:12,584
the 25th anniversary "Dr
Who" story, "Silver Nemesis",

1872
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,920
where he plays a Nazi

1873
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,630
and he goes up against some cybermen

1874
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:18,090
in the seventh doctrine, ACE.

1875
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,509
He seems like he's not terribly
interested in what's going

1876
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,052
on when you watch him in that.

1877
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,762
And I, and I've read
that he was just there

1878
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,681
so he could listen to
Wimbledon on the radio

1879
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,767
because wherever he lived,
he couldn't see Wimbledon.

1880
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,436
But he, they said he just,
when he wasn't on the set,

1881
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,563
he was in his hotel room
listening to Wimbledon matches.

1882
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,107
- [Rob] I love that, I love
that, I love these guys.

1883
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,442
It is like Nicholson in
his Laker games, you know,

1884
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,986
he's just like, "Look, I
got my priorities here.

1885
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,322
We're, we're ready to,
I'll shoot Chinatown,

1886
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,449
but I really gotta see
this final free throw."

1887
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,159
(Rob laughs)

1888
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,077
- [Dan] So, so here, yeah.

1889
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:50,497
So here we're, we're,
we're resolving this big,

1890
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,624
we're, a bunch of red
herrings are all resolving

1891
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,128
at once here, and we are gonna find out,

1892
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,338
yeah, that obviously,
Differing and Sommer,

1893
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,506
they're, they have nothing to do

1894
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,757
with the blackmail that's going on.

1895
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:05,011
And somehow our assassins are
now after Mr. Christopher,

1896
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,305
could you figure out how
exactly that happened?

1897
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,683
- [Rob] No, no, I'm still kind of,

1898
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,309
(laughs) I was impressed at the, I mean,

1899
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,353
I never, I don't know
the budget of this film,

1900
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,064
but I assume it was, you
know, fairly substantial

1901
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,108
with these, you know, these
are all name actors in it.

1902
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,776
And, but this, this whole sequence had

1903
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,862
to be pretty expensive to do.

1904
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:22,863
I mean, they're really, they're,

1905
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:26,908
they're blocking off an airport
for at least a little while,

1906
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,577
not an airport, it's a train station.

1907
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,411
- [Dan] They're in this tr-,

1908
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,329
he's not looking at those books!

1909
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,164
- [Rob] No, he's (laughs).

1910
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:32,998
- [Dan] I thought it was for a second.

1911
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,291
- [Rob] Come on, David Hess,

1912
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,375
you're not even faking it, come on.

1913
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,128
"I'm not looking, got at least
lover here on the thing."

1914
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:38,962
(Dan laughs)

1915
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:39,796
But look at that, I mean, you know,

1916
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:40,964
they have to block all this out.

1917
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,633
This is a, this is a train
station, you know what I mean?

1918
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,218
That probably was a pain to have to do.

1919
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,804
- [Dan] Yeah, and this is a
really nicely edited scene.

1920
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,723
This, the shooting right here,
this is, this is nicely done.

1921
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:53,435
So it's, it's, they had, they
had multiple setups and things

1922
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,854
and poor Anton Diff-,
actually, no, he survives.

1923
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,606
Spoiler, but yeah,

1924
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,150
that's really nicely shot right
there through the suitcase.

1925
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:00,984
- [Rob] No pun intended.

1926
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:01,818
- [Dan] That's, yeah, exactly.

1927
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:02,986
That's a nice little, you know,

1928
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,196
almost like you mentioned "De Palma",

1929
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,655
that's almost something
like a "De Palma" thing,

1930
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,365
like a shooting through some suitcases.

1931
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,533
- [Rob] In public too, you
know, like in public, you know?

1932
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,702
- [Dan] I do hope they hired extras

1933
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,788
because I'd hate to think that David Hess,

1934
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,664
because I know he, he would compare,

1935
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,125
he apparently could be very
sort of method at times.

1936
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,752
I'd hate to think it was
like, "We're gonna knock

1937
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:21,296
over those Swiss citizens," so they-

1938
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,007
- [Rob] Oh, there, oh,
there it is, gets up, oh!

1939
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,675
- [Dan] Oh, no, and I love, there he go-,

1940
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,219
he can run pretty good, I mean,

1941
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,513
for some reason I thought
he wouldn't make it.

1942
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,181
You know, he's got a bit of a, you know,

1943
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,600
"I'm the Swiss Ed Asner,"
or something to him.

1944
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:34,893
I don't know what I'm thinking when I look

1945
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,562
at him, but, but he moves.

1946
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,440
- [Rob] Yeah, he's finally
doing something here.

1947
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,983
- [Dan] And poor, poor David
Janssen, he doesn't, one

1948
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,610
of the things with "Harry
O" was that "Harry O",

1949
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,946
early on he, he had to
retire from being a cop

1950
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,697
because he had a bullet in his back.

1951
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,741
So whenever David Janssen
like ran as Harry,

1952
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,868
he had a strange limp, kind
of like he does right there.

1953
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,955
Maybe, well, I mean,
David Janssen, he, he,

1954
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,625
he didn't live easy, he,
he always had a good time,

1955
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,252
I think is the way I would say it.

1956
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,753
- [Rob] "This is the quiet car.

1957
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,922
What are you doing shooting
people in this thing here?"

1958
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:04,756
(Dan laughs)

1959
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,715
I should mention here, just as,

1960
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,845
as Mr. Benninger is sort of
exiting our film, oh, Sommer,

1961
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,972
I do wanna read one
brief paragraph about him

1962
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,306
from the novelization where it says,

1963
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:17,352
"'Franz Benninger,' the
cruder Hurtil bank clerks used

1964
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,479
to joke over their forth Löwenbräu,

1965
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:23,191
'could only reach climax if he
made love in a morning suit.'

1966
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,484
The executive vice president

1967
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,486
of Hurtil Bank came from
a family that had been

1968
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,196
with Hurtil Bank for a century,

1969
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,656
and he wore his position in the bank

1970
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,075
as if it were a bishop
presiding over the liturgy

1971
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,910
in his home cathedral."

1972
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:34,744
- [Dan] Wow.

1973
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,162
- [Rob] So they, (laughs) that's kinda-

1974
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,706
- [Dan] That's, that's the
kind of, if, if you, yeah,

1975
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:38,540
if you've never read novelizations,

1976
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,000
that's the sort of stuff you get.

1977
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,418
- [Rob] Background details you get

1978
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:44,045
on these characters in
the novelization, yeah.

1979
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,171
- [Dan] Lot of it, and what
we're getting right here

1980
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,883
is, I call this, yeah, closing
the door on the red herrings,

1981
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,802
because now the Hayes thing
with the assassins is done.

1982
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,889
And just the fact that
when, when Hurtil says

1983
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:57,058
to Ms. Rita Jensen right
there, "Blackmail,"

1984
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,561
and she says, "Blackmail,
what are you talking about?"

1985
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:00,395
- [Rob] Mmhmm.

1986
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,105
- [Dan] It's like, okay, can
we get back on the blackmail?

1987
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,482
I love that we're spending
two minutes describing,

1988
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,235
"I didn't have the
papers, you know, I wanted

1989
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,197
to get my real ID and I didn't
have the right address on my,

1990
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,908
on my, on my bill."

1991
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,492
You know, and it's just like, "Oh, man."

1992
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,078
And even David Janssen,
even Christopher is like,

1993
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,788
"Maybe we should be
working on the blackmail,

1994
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:22,542
rather than hearing this
exposition, is this necessary?"

1995
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,794
- [Rob] "I didn't remember
my eight digit pin number

1996
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:25,629
for my bank account," or whatever.

1997
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,671
- [Dan] Yes, yes, it was like,

1998
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,756
"I brought the birth certificate

1999
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,049
and they forgot to notarize it,

2000
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:30,050
they just wouldn't look at it."

2001
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:32,177
- [Rob] (laughs) This is
a lovely home she has,

2002
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,178
by the way, I love this garden.

2003
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,471
- [Dan] Yeah, yeah, or is, is this,

2004
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,348
is this a hospital or where is this?

2005
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,766
- [Rob] Is it a hospital, I
don't think, I don't know.

2006
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,642
- [Dan] I don't know
because there's a gentleman

2007
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,435
who comes out who I like
to think is the producer.

2008
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,645
- [Rob] Oh, of course it
is because the doctor just,

2009
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,105
yeah, the, yeah, they're, they're
in a hospital, yeah, yeah.

2010
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,315
- [Dan] Or again, one of the friends

2011
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:46,942
of those guys who were
in the overalls earlier.

2012
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:47,776
- [Rob] There you go.

2013
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,403
- [Dan] Like when he shows
up, he's like Ray Milland,

2014
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,655
Elke Sommer, David Janssen,

2015
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,115
and this happy guy in
like the Swiss petticoat.

2016
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,533
- [Rob] He looks really happy
to be there, this actor.

2017
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,826
- [Dan] Yeah, yeah, he's
having a great time.

2018
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:57,911
- [Rob] He's really thrilled
with his one line, yep.

2019
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,789
- [Dan] Yeah, and so we're
gonna, now we're moving

2020
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,166
towards the climax of the movie, sort of,

2021
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,334
actually it's gonna,

2022
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,877
it's gonna do something weird in a moment,

2023
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,087
but we're getting right here

2024
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:11,091
that he actually does his
main investigating now.

2025
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,385
- [Rob] He's finally,
"All right, all right."

2026
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:17,305
- [Dan] But he does it all,
he does it all like now.

2027
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,473
He's doing, he's about to start,

2028
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,392
the planes taken off,
all the investigation

2029
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,726
is gonna happen right here.

2030
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,979
And I just, and I just
wanna say one more thing

2031
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:26,773
about the assassins, oh, and that's, I,

2032
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,233
I, the thing I like about this scene,

2033
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,402
I always think of you when
I watch this scene, Rob,

2034
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,611
because I know this is the way you,

2035
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,780
you made money throughout college.

2036
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:36,950
- [Rob] (laughs) I did, I
put myself through art school

2037
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:38,702
as a, as a go-go dancer.

2038
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,078
- [Dan] Go-go dancer with a great wig.

2039
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,121
- [Rob] Yeah, look at that.

2040
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,122
- [Dan] And I, I don't think,

2041
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,581
I think I've only been in like one,

2042
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,208
and this is how, you
know, sheltered, I guess,

2043
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:49,129
I am, I've only been like in,
in one bar or club in my life

2044
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:50,797
where there were go-go dancers

2045
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:51,631
and I think they were in cages.

2046
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:53,508
- [Rob] Oh, really, you're
one up on me then, okay.

2047
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:54,884
- [Dan] Yes, just happened one time.

2048
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,136
And I think I was just stopping

2049
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,846
by to ask for directions.

2050
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,098
- [Rob] (laughs) I stopped by here just

2051
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,850
to find a way to get out of here.

2052
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,727
- [Dan] Just to find a way to leave here.

2053
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:07,564
And I just, I just wanna say,
I just, I, I, sorry, folks.

2054
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,774
I have, I have certain things
when I'm talking quickly

2055
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:10,900
and I'm, I'm slightly anxious.

2056
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,652
I have certain things I
say over and over again.

2057
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,070
Like, "I'm just gonna say this quickly,"

2058
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:18,658
I, I don't know who hires the
assassins to kill Christopher.

2059
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:22,495
My thought is this, that the
assassins are watching Hayes

2060
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,372
when he attacks Christopher.

2061
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,000
And then when they kill Hayes,
which was their assignment,

2062
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,544
and they are hired-in
assassins, they don't pick

2063
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,296
and choose what they do.

2064
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,716
They hired, what was in that
package says, "Kill this guy."

2065
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,426
They kill him, then they leave.

2066
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,303
And presumably, they
kill him in Switzerland

2067
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,764
so his body isn't in the US.

2068
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,807
So they can do, but what
I think what happens

2069
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,100
is they see this guy,

2070
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,186
they don't know who Christopher is,

2071
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,938
and they think, "Hey, we'll
put his body in a trunk

2072
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,565
and pretend it's this guy's car

2073
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:53,693
to incriminate him and then we'll leave."

2074
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,987
But as they're leaving, they
say, "Yeah, we killed the guy."

2075
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:56,863
"What'd you do with the body?"

2076
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,990
"Oh, we put it in David
Christopher's trunk."

2077
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,076
"The guy from the Department of Justice?"

2078
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:01,910
You know, like, you know,

2079
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:03,495
and they say, "Yeah," they say,

2080
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,537
"He's been giving us trouble.

2081
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:05,914
"Kill him too."

2082
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:08,208
So I think that's why they,
now I made all that up.

2083
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,709
That's not in the movie or the book,

2084
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:13,463
but I think that's why they
suddenly go from killing Hayes

2085
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,006
to wanting to kill Christopher.

2086
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,425
Because you don't like
put the body in the trunk

2087
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,552
to incriminate the guy
and then go after him.

2088
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,179
- [Rob] Right, because right then you're,

2089
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,223
then you're revealing he's not
the guy that did it, right.

2090
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,099
- [Dan] Yes, and just in the same way

2091
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:27,227
that I thought Hayes was
going to call in assassins

2092
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:30,063
to kill Christopher, rather,

2093
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:32,524
'cause my thought was maybe
he tries to kill Christopher,

2094
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,610
can't do it, then calls
the assassins and his boss

2095
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:36,945
or whoever says, "Strangely enough,

2096
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,905
we have some assassins on the way.

2097
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,990
We’ll give them another killing to do."

2098
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,992
And so it's like, first kill this guy

2099
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,285
and then the guy you just killed

2100
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,912
has hired you to kill this guy.

2101
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,914
But in the timeline, there's no time,

2102
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,749
I mean, unless as they're
killing him, he's yelling out,

2103
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,543
"Hey, guys, before you kill me,"

2104
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,044
and he pulls out a picture

2105
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,838
of David Janssen, "Could
you kill this guy?"

2106
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,172
"You got it, Mr. Hayes!"

2107
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,006
(Dan mimics gunshot)

2108
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,884
So we just got that weird scene.

2109
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,970
I think it's a weird
scene with, with the cop.

2110
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,555
And it's funny 'cause the
weird scene with the cop

2111
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,182
with them leaving cuts to
another scene with the cop.

2112
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,976
- [Rob] Another scene with
the cop (laughs) eating.

2113
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,937
All of a sudden, yeah,
all of a sudden the cop

2114
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:12,438
is like the main essential character.

2115
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,399
- [Dan] The main character
for like three minutes.

2116
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,567
The cop becomes the main character.

2117
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,193
And that previous scene was a weird one

2118
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,946
because it's basically
him recapping everything

2119
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,032
that's happened and is about to happen.

2120
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,326
- [Rob] If you would
ask actor Inigo Gallo,

2121
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,037
who plays the cop, Captain
Frey, what the movie's about,

2122
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,247
he would say, "It's about a cop

2123
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,291
that investigates a Swiss conspiracy."

2124
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:34,502
- [Dan] Exactly, exactly,
special guest star David Janssen.

2125
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,672
- [Rob] Exactly, with, yeah,
with occasional appearances.

2126
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,215
Well, guest appear-, there we go.

2127
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,758
No, there were no guest appearances, Dan.

2128
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:41,926
I said that earlier.

2129
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,344
- [Dan] (laughs) Exactly, yeah, that is,

2130
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,220
that is always so confusing.

2131
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,139
And maybe that's something from, maybe,

2132
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,308
maybe in another universe,
this was, you know,

2133
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:50,518
he had his own TV show,
"Dennis Christopher".

2134
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:51,436
(Rob chatters)

2135
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,772
"Department" or "DOJ", or
something, I don't know.

2136
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:55,607
- [Rob] Exactly, exactly.

2137
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,067
- [Dan] And, and maybe that
ends with him having to leave.

2138
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,736
And this is a follow up to that.

2139
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:04,574
I don't know, but I don't
even know what we're doing.

2140
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:07,202
Oh, yes, so, so the climax has begun,

2141
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,287
and again, this is the second sequence

2142
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,914
where we're gonna go from,

2143
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,540
we basically went from
an ugly parking lot.

2144
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,001
We're gonna go up into
the gorgeous Alps, now,

2145
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:16,502
the first time it was for sex,

2146
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,504
this time it'll be for violence.

2147
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,964
And I don't know if that means anything.

2148
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,799
I don't know if that means anything.

2149
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,761
And the movie ends leaving
out the opening scene

2150
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:26,763
where it begins on top of the Alps.

2151
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:29,015
So I think there's some sort
of cyclical thing going on,

2152
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:30,350
or I'm just full of bologna.

2153
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:32,852
I'm probably full of
bologna, but I noticed it.

2154
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,479
- [Rob] Oh, here, no, you've
got three of our suspects.

2155
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,648
And now let me, let,
let me just very quickly

2156
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,982
go through the, we didn't talk about the,

2157
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,525
the career of Senta Berger.

2158
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:40,360
- [Dan] Oh, yes, please.

2159
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:41,653
- [Rob] Or Curt Lowens,
lemme just go through the,

2160
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,238
now that they're together.

2161
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,739
- [Dan] Because they're gonna
be driving for a bit, folks.

2162
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:46,032
- [Rob] Yeah, they'll be driving for a bit

2163
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:47,325
- [Dan] So enjoy the Autobahn
and "Uncut Diamonds", yeah.

2164
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,159
- [Rob] Yeah, right, there we go.

2165
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,370
So Senta Berger was born in 1941 .

2166
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:51,704
As far as I know, she's still with us,

2167
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:52,789
like you said, like Elke Sommer.

2168
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,999
I hope she's happy, she was in
movies like "The Ambushers",

2169
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,919
"The Quiller Memorandum",
the another movie that's kind

2170
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,462
of sounds like this,
"The Quiller Memorandum".

2171
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,588
- [Dan] Yeah, like the
"Cassandra Crossing", yeah.

2172
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,924
- [Rob] "Cassandra Crossing", "de Sade",

2173
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,717
"If It's Tuesday, This Must be Belgium",

2174
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:07,011
which again, I like seeing
those two films back to back.

2175
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:10,181
"When Women Had Tails" and the sequel,

2176
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,642
"When Women Lost Their Tails".

2177
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,936
I didn't know that that
first film made enough money

2178
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:15,770
that there was a second (laughs).

2179
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:16,938
- [Dan] Hey, if, if, if every,

2180
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,606
if anyone's putting that out on Blu,

2181
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,732
I think you got two guys here who’ll

2182
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,150
do the commentary for both of those.

2183
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,318
- [Rob] (laughs) Yeah,
let's, let's call her shot.

2184
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:24,195
- [Dan] Discount, discount
for "Uncut Diamonds".

2185
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,323
- [Rob] (laughs) She was
also in "Cross of Iron".

2186
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:30,576
And then Curt Lowens,
he passed away in 2017.

2187
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,412
He was in movies like "Angels and Demons",

2188
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:34,622
"The Midnight Clear" and "The Entity".

2189
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,293
Great movie, "The Mephisto
Waltz" with Alan Alda.

2190
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,127
- [Dan] Oh, with Alan Alda, yeah!

2191
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,086
- [Rob] And the reason I mention that is

2192
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,964
because I know him from his
guest appearance on one episode

2193
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:46,259
of "MASH" he is in, which of
course also featured Alan Alda.

2194
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:49,929
He plays a, he plays a colonel
from Luxembourg who comes

2195
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,514
to retrieve a dead soldier

2196
01:11:51,598 --> 01:11:53,516
who we find out is not actually dead.

2197
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,350
- [Dan] Oh.

2198
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,184
- [Rob] And he's very funny.

2199
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:56,352
So that, that's Curt Lowens, here.

2200
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,603
So yeah, those are, those, our two.

2201
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,897
I wanna make sure we mention
the credits of the these two.

2202
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,566
- [Dan] Yes, yes, yes.

2203
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:05,820
And I'm, I'll just do while,
while we're looking here, and,

2204
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:08,323
and there's an interesting
thing, which I think is,

2205
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:11,409
is, this is less suspicious
in the novelization,

2206
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,745
I think, than it is here,
where McGowan suddenly says,

2207
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:14,912
"Sorry, can't do it."

2208
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,582
- [Rob] Yeah, he begs out
out, yeah, he just, yeah,

2209
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:18,499
he punks out, yep.

2210
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:21,419
- [Dan] For, for some reason
they, they present him

2211
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,712
by giving him more background,

2212
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:25,173
the novelization, you know
that he is a sick man.

2213
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,466
- [Rob] He's taking his
heart pills there, right?

2214
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,884
- [Dan] Yes, exactly, exactly.

2215
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:29,469
- [Rob] "Sorry, Davey, boy,
that's as far as I go."

2216
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:31,471
- [Dan] And of course when
the movie ends, you know,

2217
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:34,057
this, he's, he's handing
him the bologna right here.

2218
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:37,310
All three of them are handing
David Janssen a big pile

2219
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:41,939
of wurst, and, and,
but, but here, it seems

2220
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,149
to me it seems suspicious,

2221
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:44,776
in the novelization it seems more like it

2222
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,027
could actually have happened.

2223
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,237
But it does seem strange that, you know,

2224
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:51,824
he possibly didn't know
where they were going

2225
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,036
or like, I mean, I mean,
obviously he's faking it,

2226
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,662
so it doesn't matter in the end.

2227
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:58,289
- [Rob] Right, yeah, right, he's making

2228
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,999
up anything that sounds plausible.

2229
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:00,875
- [Dan] And, and I just wanna mention,

2230
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,710
John Saxon and David Hess real quick,

2231
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:03,878
and I also always say, I think,

2232
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:04,796
I always think like the limo's

2233
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,422
gonna hit the car right there.

2234
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,049
It comes so, and there's John Ireland

2235
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:09,717
in the background tearing out

2236
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,470
and he's like, "You guys still acting,

2237
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,639
'cause I'm, they're
sending me up the hill?

2238
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:17,225
I'm gonna talk to you later, bye-bye."

2239
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,936
It's such a, it's a weirdly awkward use

2240
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,646
of the frame to have like,

2241
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,398
I wonder if it's something
like where Jack Arnold was

2242
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:26,109
behind the camera going, "No,
don't back into the shots.

2243
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:26,943
What are you doing?"

2244
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:28,528
- [Rob] "Just drive out of the frame,

2245
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:29,946
don't worry about it," yeah, yeah.

2246
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,489
- [Dan] We, we've got,
our actors are trying

2247
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:35,034
to do something that's so distracting.

2248
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,452
Oh, and here's the cop again.

2249
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:37,662
Like, we're pretending the cop is going

2250
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,455
to get involved in the ending.

2251
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:44,043
So David Hess was born in
36, died in I believe 2011 .

2252
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,878
And like I said, he was a songwriter,

2253
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,672
first off, he did the soundtrack

2254
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:48,798
for "Last House on the Left",

2255
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:52,343
which is alternately
goofy and so depressing.

2256
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,928
And of course, yeah, his
big thing was "Last House

2257
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:55,638
on the Left" where he played Krug.

2258
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:58,266
I've seen "Last House on
the Left" several times.

2259
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,435
It's a good movie, but
not maybe something you

2260
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,854
wanna have fun watching on
an after, watch this instead.

2261
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:03,729
- [Rob] No.

2262
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:06,357
- [Dan] And he, he was in "Hitchhike",

2263
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,650
Mario Bava's "Hitchhike".

2264
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:10,319
He was in "House on the Edge
of the Park", which is sleazy,

2265
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,864
but somehow more fun than
"Last House on the Left".

2266
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,283
He was in the fun
mid-eighties Italian slasher,

2267
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:19,662
"Body Count", he was
in, oh, and he directed,

2268
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,873
I think he was on an episode of "Manimal".

2269
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:25,293
Don't quote me on that,
but he directed the fun,

2270
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:29,046
very early slasher in 1980,
"To All a Good Night",

2271
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:32,008
a Santa Claus killer,
slasher set in a sorority.

2272
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:33,050
So he was a great guy, very,

2273
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,304
from what I know, rather congenial fellow.

2274
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,805
Although he looked like
he would, you know,

2275
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,141
maybe punch you in the face, you know,

2276
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:41,434
as much, so much as look at you, but,

2277
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:42,268
but I guess he was pretty-

2278
01:14:42,352 --> 01:14:43,478
- [Rob] Like David Janssen, I'm guessing.

2279
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:44,520
- [Dan] Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

2280
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,272
So, so, and, and then, yeah, John Saxon

2281
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:50,902
and Carmine Orrico was his, his name.

2282
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:54,155
And 1936, say, he was actually
born a month and a half

2283
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,366
before David Hess, probably
in the same hospital.

2284
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,494
Oh, we got another Saxon through here.

2285
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:00,495
I bet they born with,

2286
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,038
Hess was born with a full head of hair.

2287
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:06,125
John Saxon, 1936, died in
2020, and he was in everything.

2288
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:06,959
(train chugs)

2289
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,961
I mean, I don't even feel
like I need to go into it.

2290
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:09,962
I mean, he was in "Black Christmas",

2291
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:12,507
he was in "Night Caller from Outer Space".

2292
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,425
I'm jumping all over, he
was in "Rock Pretty Baby",

2293
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,594
"Enter the Dragon", of course.

2294
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:19,138
He was in three of the
"Nightmare on Elm Street" films.

2295
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:22,391
He was in several of the Gene
Roddenberry failed pilots

2296
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,727
of the 70s, "Planet Earth",
"Strange New World".

2297
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:27,021
He was in, he was in "Fast Company",

2298
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,397
he was in "The Glove", he was

2299
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,900
in "Prisoner of the Lost Universe".

2300
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,568
He was in, he was a starring guy

2301
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,403
in "The Bold Ones", "The New Doctors".

2302
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:37,198
He was in everything,
he's freaking John Saxon.

2303
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:39,116
I'm gonna stop talking and we’ll go on

2304
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,910
to what's happening right here, which is-

2305
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,537
- [Rob] They're in a
funicular, which is just a,

2306
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:47,458
a word I love to say, (laughs) funicular.

2307
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,377
- [Dan] And, and it's at,
it's at, it's at this point

2308
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:51,379
where you realize that, you know,

2309
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:53,256
maybe they all don't have
much to say to each other,

2310
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,091
you know, that it's, the tension is up

2311
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:56,926
and the, the small talk is over.

2312
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,344
They don't have much more to say.

2313
01:15:58,428 --> 01:15:59,679
They're, they're just
kind of, and I think even

2314
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:00,888
in the novelization, it's mentioned here

2315
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:04,267
that no one really says anything
as this train with this,

2316
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,352
again, the guy, the
conductor of the train,

2317
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:08,354
I feel like is part of that family, who,

2318
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,022
of the guy who played the doctor

2319
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,399
and the two guys who ran
out in the parking garage.

2320
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:12,650
- [Rob] Yeah, the overall guy, yep.

2321
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,527
- [Dan] I, I feel like maybe they're,

2322
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:15,695
maybe they're all the same family.

2323
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:18,573
So I love they keep cutting
too, like I don't know

2324
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,075
that you need to cross
cut to the cop this often.

2325
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,368
(movie chatters)

2326
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:25,538
I, because he arrives late,
he always arrives late.

2327
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:27,540
- [Rob] They are not in
weather gear, by the way.

2328
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:28,374
- [Dan] Yes.

2329
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:30,418
- [Rob] In proper winter
gear here, their dress shirts

2330
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:33,963
and their floor chimes,
walking through the snow here.

2331
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:36,257
- [Dan] That's one of the
big, I mean, like, my thought,

2332
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:39,719
my first thought when they're
right here at the ski lift is

2333
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:42,847
that maybe, maybe that's
the way the Alps works.

2334
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,182
Maybe it's a lot warmer than it looks.

2335
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:49,854
- [Rob] I, okay, all
right, Dan, all right.

2336
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,731
All right, so we are heading

2337
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,357
into the last 10 minutes of this film.

2338
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,191
- [Dan] Yes.

2339
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,026
- [Rob] Very briefly, very blunt,

2340
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,862
I just wanna get to a couple
of contemporary reviews.

2341
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:58,696
- [Dan] Oh, yes, yes.

2342
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,947
- [Rob] That I found, which
are absolutely marvelous.

2343
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,825
So this, this one was released in Europe

2344
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,327
and then a year later in America.

2345
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,245
So a lot of the American
reviews, they're kind of,

2346
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,997
it's a fait accompli at that point.

2347
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,290
The film had sort of come and gone.

2348
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:12,418
Here we go, that guy, the guy
in the, running the train.

2349
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:15,087
But anyway, I found one
from the Chicago Tribune

2350
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:17,131
by Gene Siskel, the Gene Siskel.

2351
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:17,965
- [Dan] Oh, wow, wow.

2352
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,468
- [Rob] He rated the film cheesy.

2353
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:21,969
He says, "Ray Milland,

2354
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:25,014
who looks very sad now that he is bald,"

2355
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:26,849
which is incredibly mean-spirited.

2356
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:30,061
And also coming from Siskel is
kind of a curious criticism.

2357
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:30,895
(Dan laughs)

2358
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:34,440
He says, "The script writers
shouldn't want any publicity.

2359
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:36,567
There's not much of a story here.

2360
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,820
A thriller without
thrills," which is kind of,

2361
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:40,988
very good, very mean-spirited.

2362
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:41,781
- [Dan] Yeah.

2363
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:44,033
- [Rob] The East Times'
Kent and Male said,

2364
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:45,076
"Senta Berger as one

2365
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,036
of the blackmail victims provides sparkle

2366
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,788
in a rather mundane plot."

2367
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,207
The Daily Mirror, "Lots
of nice alpine scenery,

2368
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:53,292
but no dramatic peaks are scaled."

2369
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,628
All right, I gotta give 'em,
that was, yeah, that's okay,

2370
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:56,837
that was clever, I'll give 'em that.

2371
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:57,672
(Dan laughs)

2372
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,882
The Richmond Time Dispatch
from Richmond, Virginia,

2373
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:02,635
"Good suspense and a good
look at the closed doors

2374
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,345
of the Swiss banking business."

2375
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:05,888
That's a bit positive.

2376
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:07,306
The Observer in London, a,

2377
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:09,517
"As full of holes as a string vest.

2378
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:14,605
It is grotesquely overacted,
Milland, Saxon, Ireland,

2379
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:17,149
though Janssen is pleasantly relaxed

2380
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,442
as the pr-," that's the way I'd put it.

2381
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,403
"Pleasantly relaxed as the private eye

2382
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:21,529
who ambles through it."

2383
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:24,657
- [Dan] Yeah, that's okay.

2384
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,534
- [Rob] The Morning News,
Wilmington, Delaware,

2385
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:28,994
"Elke Sommer got a birthday
cake, which was a wheel

2386
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,913
of Swiss cheese dotted with candles

2387
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:32,415
during the making of this film."

2388
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:33,290
(Dan laughs)

2389
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,584
And then curiously, I
found a credit, a, a,

2390
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:39,338
a story in Newsday from Nassau,
New York that says, right,

2391
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,298
it was a, is an article about Robert Shaw.

2392
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,468
And it says, "Right after Jaws, Shaw went

2393
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:48,556
to work on 'The Swiss
Conspiracy', starring John Voight

2394
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,058
and directed by Maximilian Shell."

2395
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,685
And I'm like, "Wait, what?"

2396
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:54,562
And I thought, "Were they
attached to this film?

2397
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:56,522
And then they got," no,

2398
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:58,816
it turns out that's a movie
called "End of the Game",

2399
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,359
which was directed by Maximilian Shell

2400
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:01,444
and has Robert Shaw and John Voight.

2401
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:04,280
And so whoever wrote that
article just simply mistook

2402
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,240
that movie for "The Swiss Conspiracy".

2403
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:07,867
And then that, that got run

2404
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,035
in like a dozen different articles, so.

2405
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,454
- [Dan] Wow, that's, that's interesting.

2406
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:12,288
'Cause we all know at this time,

2407
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,831
Maximilian Shell was in that ship

2408
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,082
on the edge of the black hole.

2409
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,709
- [Rob] (laughs) That's right.

2410
01:19:16,793 --> 01:19:18,794
- [Dan] Waiting for Ernest
Borgnine to show up.

2411
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,296
- [Rob] And then, (laughs)
and then one other thing I

2412
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:23,007
wanna mention is some of the
double bills this played on,

2413
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:23,883
which I find fascinating.

2414
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:26,886
It mostly, it mostly played with, as a,

2415
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:30,473
as a second feature to "St.
Ives", the Charles Bronson film,

2416
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,057
which, it's solid, that makes sense.

2417
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:32,892
- [Dan] Yeah, yeah.

2418
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:35,603
- [Rob] It also played a lot of times

2419
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,688
as a second bill to "Trial by Combat",

2420
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,441
which is a Donald Pleasants war film.

2421
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:41,609
I've not seen that film.

2422
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:45,988
I found it playing in the
Leicester, England car park.

2423
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:48,407
This is the, these were
the movies you could see

2424
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:50,367
in one night at this theater, right?

2425
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:55,456
"Swiss Conspiracy", "Dog Day
Afternoon", "The Exorcist",

2426
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:58,000
"Jesus Christ, Superstar",

2427
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,628
and the X-rated porn
film, "Dance of Ecstasy".

2428
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:03,631
I mean, that was, movies
were just great in the 70s.

2429
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:05,883
- [Dan] Down in Leicester Square,
they're having a good time

2430
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,009
watching whatever the hell you want.

2431
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:09,303
- [Rob] Can you imagine
going to the theater

2432
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:12,807
and deciding, "Do I want to
see 'Jesus Christ, Superstar',

2433
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,893
'The Exorcist' or 'The Swiss Conspiracy'?"

2434
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:16,727
- [Dan] And I bet you,

2435
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,396
I read the novelization
of "The Swiss Conspiracy".

2436
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,650
It's pretty spicy, all
right, screw the ecstasy.

2437
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,068
We're getting Janssen and Berger.

2438
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,986
- [Rob] Want two tickets to
that, please, absolutely.

2439
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:26,821
- [Dan] Let's do it.

2440
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,240
And it's funny because the,
the cover of the book and the,

2441
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:30,825
and the poster has a great thing

2442
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,994
where it shows like a cutoff dead guy

2443
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,747
in a ski lift-car-thing.

2444
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,667
But like dollar bills are
flying all over the place.

2445
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,501
- [Rob] Oh, it's great.

2446
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,920
- [Dan] There's no, it's a,
it's a fantastic, it's a killer.

2447
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:45,089
It's like, like, like
one of those great sort

2448
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,257
of like "Eiger Sanction"
kind of super cool.

2449
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,509
- [Rob] Yeah, oh, another
one, "Eiger Sanction" is kind

2450
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:51,512
of a, you know, similar
kind of read to it.

2451
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:54,974
- [Dan] Yeah, so, so right
here we are getting that it,

2452
01:20:55,058 --> 01:21:00,062
it turns out that Mr. Christopher
has done investigation

2453
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:03,190
and right here he reveals
everything that's going on,

2454
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,568
including all the stuff with, what is it?

2455
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:09,363
Lord James Asher Wood, who like,

2456
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:10,906
like I said, in the novelization,

2457
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:15,244
she is, Ms. Abbott is a
model who just happens

2458
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:16,954
to be blackmailing a lord.

2459
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,414
In the movie, it seems like she

2460
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:20,708
makes her living blackmailing this lord,

2461
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:22,543
which would seem to be tenuous.

2462
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:24,962
And how do you fill out
the tax forms on that?

2463
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:28,090
Although, does that really
matter in Switzerland?

2464
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:30,718
Blackmailing is probably a
thing you could put, right?

2465
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:32,803
In Switzerland, they're not
gonna come to you and go like,

2466
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,598
"Hey," here we go, the big reveal.

2467
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,518
McGowan is sick, but
he's not quite as sick.

2468
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,394
- [Rob] No, not that sick.

2469
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:43,314
- [Dan] "I'll pop my
heart pills and go," I,

2470
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,941
I always wonder why he
didn't take him off the lift.

2471
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:46,859
Because isn't that like,

2472
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:48,611
like wouldn’t that give him more time?

2473
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:49,445
I mean, they're on the lift anyways.

2474
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:51,071
- [Rob] That's true, yeah, you
would think that would not,

2475
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:52,865
you'd want, wanna see that Curt Lowens

2476
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:53,908
had been shot dead there.

2477
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:55,868
- [Dan] Yeah, yeah,
like, like 'cause that,

2478
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:57,328
'cause up until, because,

2479
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,370
'cause right now it's gonna happen if,

2480
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:01,707
if Lowens wasn't there, they'd
just be going up there and,

2481
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:03,334
and you know, it's sort of revealed that,

2482
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,085
that Christopher knows what's going on

2483
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,128
and they're still look, like right,

2484
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:07,755
that shot, they're still
looking back at him.

2485
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:08,589
- [Rob] Yep, yep.

2486
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:09,423
- [Dan] Like the back of his head,

2487
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:10,257
maybe it seemed like the
bullet came out the back,

2488
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,718
gross, and, but,

2489
01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:14,887
but they would've just seen
maybe like a helicopter taking

2490
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:16,096
off or something like that.

2491
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:17,765
Maybe been confused by this.

2492
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:18,807
But, but they know now that

2493
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,477
who's ever in the helicopter is, ah,

2494
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:24,188
and can I just, I, I, I finished
that sentence in the middle

2495
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:25,397
because you know where I was going there,

2496
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:26,857
because I, we're running out of time

2497
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,359
and I want to talk about how fragile

2498
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,569
helicopters are apart from Blue Thunder.

2499
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,071
- [Rob] (laughs) All he
had to do is hit the tail,

2500
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:33,697
hit the rotor once with the bullet

2501
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:34,865
and it just bails outta control.

2502
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,785
- [Dan] It's, it's funny,
like I, I live in Los Angeles

2503
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:39,161
and about once every month

2504
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:41,330
or two we'll get, like at
some point during the day,

2505
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:43,624
a bunch of helicopters
will appear above us.

2506
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:46,293
Now, luckily we've never had
fugitives David Janssen running

2507
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,586
through our backyard or anything,

2508
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,630
but like those helicopters
seem pretty sturdy.

2509
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:50,464
- [Rob] Yep.

2510
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:52,216
- [Dan] And helicopters
in movies, poor guy.

2511
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,551
- [Rob] Oh, right at
the edge of a cliff too.

2512
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,887
- [Dan] Here he goes, and I
love this shot where he peers

2513
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,806
over and it's still falling

2514
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,349
- [Rob] Body (laughs).

2515
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:02,017
- [Dan] It's still going, I just, in,

2516
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,728
in my mind they do
like, they do like tours

2517
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,480
of the Alps, showing off like, you know,

2518
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:08,732
they shot "On Her Majesty's
Secret Service" here.

2519
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,609
They shot "Goldfinger" on this road.

2520
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,069
And if you look at the base of this cliff,

2521
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,405
you'll find a mannequin that
looks like John Ireland.

2522
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,615
- [Rob] (laughs) We never
bothered to get it out of the,

2523
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,741
out of the ravine.

2524
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,535
- [Dan] Yeah, exactly,
"Just leave it there.

2525
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:20,703
Just leave it there," you know.

2526
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,204
And there are pictures
like in, like people

2527
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:24,123
from Ohio like holding up the mannequin

2528
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:25,916
and smiling next to it, and so.

2529
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:26,917
(Rob laughs)

2530
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,253
But yeah, so, so yeah, it turns out, yeah,

2531
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,256
that there was a lot of
misdirection in this movie

2532
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,676
and it turns out that he was
actually correct in not going

2533
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,137
into the bank because it had
nothing to do with the bank.

2534
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:40,097
It's a very, I, I do like the ending here

2535
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,100
because to me it's very,
very sort of Agatha Christie,

2536
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,101
you might almost have seen Poirot,

2537
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,562
although Poirot would never
have gone up the ski lift.

2538
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:47,604
- [Rob] No.

2539
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,732
- [Dan] You might have seen
Poirot with something like this

2540
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:53,444
where all the misdirection
is towards assassins

2541
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,904
and the, the vice president and the bank,

2542
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:57,906
but it's actually not, it's the
simplest thing in the world.

2543
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:00,367
Five people who needed money basically

2544
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:01,660
blackmailed each other.

2545
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:04,830
- [Rob] Great, great,
that's a great ending.

2546
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:06,623
It is, I, I almost wish they

2547
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,667
had explained it a
little more dramatically.

2548
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:11,295
Like, but it's a great,
it's a great wrap up.

2549
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:12,880
By the way, that gun, let that gun,

2550
01:24:12,964 --> 01:24:14,214
what is it gonna have like a pellet in it?

2551
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:17,009
What's she gonna do,
not gonna stop anybody.

2552
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:19,386
- [Dan] Exactly, it's
a lighter, yeah, it's-

2553
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:20,220
- [Rob] I love that simple gag.

2554
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:21,305
Just throw the diamonds at her

2555
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,348
and while she catches the
diamonds, grab the gun.

2556
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:25,267
- [Dan] Yeah, because she's not gonna let,

2557
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:27,394
she's not gonna let these
gross uncut diamonds

2558
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:28,812
drop two feet into snow.

2559
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:29,938
(Rob laughs)

2560
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,815
I guess, I guess you, I'm,
I'm making fun of that.

2561
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,401
But, but I guess at this moment,
I mean this is probably one

2562
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,737
of the tense moments of
their, her life, right,

2563
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:38,280
so I would probably drop the gun too.

2564
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:40,074
- [Rob] And now she's gonna sell this

2565
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,575
and of course she's a beautiful woman

2566
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:44,161
and he's gonna fall for this, yeah.

2567
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,997
- [Dan] And I do love, "Can you explain,"

2568
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,999
and then just Mr.
Christopher's response, yeah.

2569
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,667
It's basically like,
"yeah, but it's gonna,

2570
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:51,835
it's gonna take a little time."

2571
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,962
And I do like, I do like that very much.

2572
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:56,256
'Cause I can't tell right
here from the cop whether

2573
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,467
or not like the next six hours is gonna

2574
01:24:58,551 --> 01:24:59,968
be Mr. Christopher in a cell.

2575
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:01,178
- [Rob] Right, yeah.

2576
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,012
- [Dan] Having to explain what happened

2577
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:02,888
with him believing her.

2578
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:05,891
I'd like to think at this
point he's like, "You know, I,

2579
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:08,644
I kind of believe David Janssen now

2580
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:10,562
and I kind of know that, you know,

2581
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,482
he didn't do this,"
kind of thing, you know.

2582
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:14,733
'Cause if you look at
it like now, now four

2583
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:17,402
of the five people are
dead who were blackmailed

2584
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,821
and she's the only one left.

2585
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:21,782
- [Rob] So yeah, our, our,
our chopper shot here,

2586
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:22,616
- [Dan] Our beautiful shot here.

2587
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,536
- [Rob] God, he's gotta be
cold, he's gotta be freeing!

2588
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,496
- [Dan] I, I'd like to
think he had a little flask

2589
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,789
in his pocket that he sipped right

2590
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:30,165
before they said action and right after.

2591
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,959
- [Rob] I think that was probably true

2592
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,627
of any given scene in this movie (laughs).

2593
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:35,504
- [Dan] Possibly, yes, possibly, and-

2594
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:36,797
- [Rob] Look at that snow.

2595
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:37,631
- [Dan] This is so gorgeous.

2596
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:38,841
- [Rob] He had to stand
there for a long time.

2597
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:39,925
- [Dan] He's on this like reaching

2598
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:41,218
and my first thought was, "Oh,

2599
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:42,719
they're using that helicopter," but, no.

2600
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,346
- [Rob] But they're right,
they're not, there it is!

2601
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:46,348
It's right there, the second chopper,

2602
01:25:46,432 --> 01:25:48,058
Jack Arnold, good for you, man.

2603
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:50,519
- [Dan] One of my, one,
a favorite film of mine,

2604
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:52,855
made around this time, "Blazing
Magnum", which is sort of a,

2605
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:56,817
one of those Politzzo
names that I can't say is,

2606
01:25:56,901 --> 01:25:58,235
which is set in Toronto.

2607
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,445
There's a scene in that where a guy shoots

2608
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:03,657
down a helicopter, kind
of with more firepower

2609
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:04,783
than David Janssen does.

2610
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:05,617
- [Rob] And there we go.

2611
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:06,660
- [Dan] But he, yeah, so.

2612
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:07,953
(Rob mimics credit music)

2613
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:09,329
- [Dan] And, and, and again, yeah,

2614
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:10,914
we cut to the great "Oom-Pah-Pah" music

2615
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,791
and now we're get this great theme.

2616
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:13,625
(funky synthesizer music)

2617
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,335
And I love this because this theme plays

2618
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,629
throughout the movie and it's
sort of like the, the base

2619
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:20,174
of it is like funky and
there's the clavinet

2620
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:23,385
and then the sort of main theme,

2621
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:26,680
(mimics theme music)
is almost giallo-esque.

2622
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:27,514
(funky synthesizer music)

2623
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:30,601
So it's sort of like you get
very European on top with the,

2624
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:32,227
with the women going, "Da, da,"

2625
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,354
and the synth actually going
(mimics synthesizer music),

2626
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:37,482
but underneath you get
(mimics credit music),

2627
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:40,402
so it's like on top he thinks
he's like Ennio Morricone,

2628
01:26:40,486 --> 01:26:42,863
but he really feels
like he's Stevie Wonder.

2629
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:44,448
And I kind of like, it's a fun theme.

2630
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,283
(funky synthesizer music)

2631
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:47,910
And two, the two movies Jack Arnold made

2632
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:49,995
before this were Blaxploitation films.

2633
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:52,706
So bringing the funk into this theme.

2634
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,082
- [Rob] What a career,
what a career, you know?

2635
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:54,917
- [Dan] What a career!

2636
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:56,084
- [Rob] Good for you, yeah.

2637
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:59,796
- [Dan] Yeah, that's, yeah,
that's so, so that is, I,

2638
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,257
I don't think I have anything
more to say, I mean, I could-

2639
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:05,552
- [Rob] That's "The Swiss
Conspiracy", everybody,

2640
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:08,222
that's, it's, it was a fun watch.

2641
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,266
I was really, realty thrilled

2642
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,477
that Film Masters would
ask you and I to do this.

2643
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,145
I, I had not seen this film before

2644
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,856
and I had so much fun researching it

2645
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,483
and watching it multiple times, trying

2646
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,151
to figure out the plot and failing

2647
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,237
and just being like, "That's
fine, I'm okay with that."

2648
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:25,739
But, man, it was just a blast doing this

2649
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:27,616
with you, Dan, this this was a fun time.

2650
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,450
- [Dan] Yeah, it was a great time, Rob,

2651
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:29,660
and I hope y'all enjoyed it

2652
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,370
and the movie's ending and go back

2653
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:33,163
and watch it again with all we've said.

2654
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,206
Go back and watch it again.

2655
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,707
You'll, you'll be glad you did.

2656
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,042
Thanks for listening everyone.

2657
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:38,460
- [Rob] Long live physical media.

2658
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:42,047
