1
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,634
- [Narrator] Switzerland,

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,762
a country internationally
famous for its fine watches,

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,724
its great skiing, and
its luxurious resorts,

4
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,643
but Switzerland's biggest
industry is banking.

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,855
Because Swiss banks are
unique in all the world.

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,732
They have secret numbered accounts

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,235
and the owner's name is always
held in strictest confidence.

8
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,071
This secrecy is protected
by the Swiss government.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,282
No individual, no corporation,

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,993
not even the power of a
government can discover the name

11
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,202
of a depositor.

12
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,370
For this reason,

13
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,331
anyone with a great deal
of money to hide knows

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,084
that Switzerland is the safest sanctuary.

15
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,919
Criminals, tax evaders,

16
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,840
and political agents all find
Swiss banks the perfect place

17
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,677
to conceal their dirty money
and their dirty secrets.

18
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,890
The system is considered
foolproof, or at least it was.

19
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,105
(guests chatter)

20
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,734
(plates clink)

21
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,964
(gun clicks)

22
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,303
(gun fires)

23
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:41,391
(glass shatters)
(guests scream)

24
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,773
(upbeat music)

25
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,471
(upbeat music continues)

26
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,209
(upbeat music continues)

27
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,489
(upbeat music continues)

28
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,603
(upbeat music continues)

29
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,454
(employee speaking in foreign language)

30
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,997
(client speaking in foreign language)

31
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,752
(employee speaking in foreign language)

32
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,183
(employee knocks)

33
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:38,986
(employee speaking in foreign language)

34
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,584
(letter opener clinks)

35
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,258
(secretary knocks)

36
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,639
(luggage thumps)

37
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:13,645
(announcer speaking in foreign language)

38
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,048
- Your passport, please.

39
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,425
Thank you.

40
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,680
Mr. Hayes?

41
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,766
- Yeah?

42
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,476
- The purpose of your visit?

43
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,435
- Business.

44
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,313
- Do you have anything to declare?

45
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,564
- No, nothing.

46
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,075
- Have a nice trip, Mr. Hayes.

47
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,993
- Thank you very much.

48
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,040
(suspenseful music)

49
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,946
(trunk thumps)

50
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,668
(engine rumbles)

51
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,805
(Franz knocks)

52
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,142
- Herr Hurtil.

53
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,902
(paper rustles)

54
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,072
- The writing is the same.

55
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,875
"If you want your clients'
secret bank accounts

56
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,378
to remain secret, you'll
pay us 10 million francs.

57
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,713
Wait for instructions."

58
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,425
- I don't understand.

59
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,927
Why should we pay 1 0 million francs

60
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,721
to these people, whoever they are?

61
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,307
What are we to do?

62
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,558
Go to the police?

63
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,018
- Never!

64
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,103
(phone buzzes)

65
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:00,937
Yes?

66
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,065
- Mr. Dwight McGowan
from America just phoned.

67
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,110
He insisted on coming
to see you immediately.

68
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,028
- Very well.

69
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,696
When he gets here, I'll see him.

70
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
- Another one?

71
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,617
- An American McGowan.

72
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,412
Earlier I got a call from
Herr Kosta from Amsterdam.

73
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,165
He said it was a matter
of extreme urgency.

74
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,376
I think I need a drink.

75
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,171
What about you?

76
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,297
- [Franz] Definitely.

77
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,594
- You hear the name David Christopher?

78
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,888
- [Franz] You mean that
American in Geneva?

79
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,097
- An American used to be

80
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,975
with the United States
Department of Justice.

81
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,477
He knows a great many names

82
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,270
and can pull a great many strings,

83
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,564
as we well know, both of us.

84
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,944
(upbeat music)

85
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,450
(bell clangs)

86
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,809
(engine rumbles)

87
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,478
(tires squeal)

88
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,359
- Lady.

89
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,778
Lady!

90
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,113
What in the hell are you doing?

91
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,615
- You were planning to park in my spot?

92
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,826
I'm so sorry, shall I move?

93
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,954
- Forget it.

94
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,247
- Oh, look, he's moving out.

95
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,916
I will hold the place for
you, but this time be quick.

96
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,750
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

97
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,336
It's for this gentleman over here.

98
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,254
Hurry.

99
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,468
You must hurry, you see?

100
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,767
You forgive me?

101
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,394
- I forgive you.

102
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,645
- Good.

103
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,647
We Ferrari owners must stick together.

104
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,899
Auf wiedersehen.

105
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,870
(car honks)

106
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,674
- Oh, not again.

107
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,092
- Looks like it.

108
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,310
(crowd chatters)

109
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,277
- Now, lady, we gotta
stop meeting like this.

110
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,404
- Yes, people will talk.

111
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,490
I have an appointment.
- I have an appointment.

112
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,532
- (laughs) You too.

113
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,410
- Tell you what we'll
do, we’ll toss a coin.

114
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,746
I think I've got a two headed one here.

115
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,790
I'm gonna toss it to see who goes first.

116
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,667
- Very well, I call heads.

117
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,339
(upbeat music)

118
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,036
- Ah, Ms. Abbott.

119
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,999
Mr. Christopher, it's
awfully generous of you

120
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,293
to interrupt your vacation
at such short notice.

121
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,920
However, I completely forgot

122
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,173
that Ms. Abbott is always on
time for her appointments.

123
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,299
- (laughs) Thanks, sir.

124
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,427
- Won't you come in, please, both of you?

125
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,813
(phone buzzes)

126
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,231
- [Speaker] Mr. Hayes from Chicago is here

127
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,733
to see Mr. Benninger.

128
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,652
- Very well, Burnham, send him in.

129
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,908
Herr Benninger and Mr. Robert
Hayes of Chicago to see you.

130
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,244
- Much as I'd like to take advantage

131
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,912
of your very delightful company,

132
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,498
I think it best if we get to
the point of this meeting.

133
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,332
- Of course.

134
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,127
- Now, Ms. Abbott, the bank
has retained Mr. Christopher

135
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,795
in this special emergency

136
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,256
to protect the interest of its clients

137
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,633
and I wanted him to meet you.

138
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,719
- Why does Ms. Abbott need protection?

139
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,724
- I asked the bank for a statement.

140
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,725
This is it.

141
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,149
- A routine statement
identified by a number only.

142
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,818
- Compare the two, and you will know

143
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,237
why I had trouble sleeping
the last two nights.

144
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,990
- "Mademoiselle Denise Abbott,

145
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,202
unless you pay us 1 million
Swiss francs to be silent,

146
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,080
why you have a numbered account
will be revealed in London."

147
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,874
- 1 million francs.

148
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,626
Isn't that stupid?

149
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,212
Where am I going to get a million francs?

150
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,132
And they can see what I've
got, 200,000 or something.

151
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,091
Less now.

152
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,261
- Ms. Abbott, the first steps
have already been taken.

153
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,348
I'm sure Mr. Christopher
will have some questions

154
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,265
to ask you.

155
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,103
And I propose that you make
yourself available to him later.

156
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,939
- Of course.

157
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,482
Mr. Christopher.

158
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,316
- If you need any help,

159
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
don't hesitate to call us at the bank

160
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,945
or Mr. Christopher's at
the Roundhouse Daughter.

161
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,905
- I'm at the Bellevue.

162
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,823
Auf wiedersehen.
- Auf wiedersehen.

163
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,332
- Delighted to have you
with us again, Mr. Hayes.

164
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,625
Did you have a good trip?

165
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,502
- Cut the crap, Benninger.

166
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,420
You got some explaining to do.

167
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,218
There's a million there
for account number 763421 .

168
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,890
This, this is what I got
to show from my account.

169
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,061
I trusted you and your damn bank.

170
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,898
Now somebody squealed my
goddamn number to somebody

171
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,609
and I'm dead unless I come
up with a million francs

172
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,027
like today.

173
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,613
- "Robert Hayes, unless you
pay us 1 million Swiss francs

174
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,576
to be silent, your secret bank
statement will be revealed

175
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,869
to your business associates."

176
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,786
- Yeah.

177
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,914
- I'm terribly sorry.

178
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:35,832
- Sorry, bullshit.

179
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,793
I want to know what
you're gonna do about it.

180
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,879
- So Denise Abbott is the fourth victim

181
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,297
in the last 24 hours,

182
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,759
the others being Andre
Kosta from Amsterdam,

183
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,970
Dwight McGowan from Los Angeles,

184
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,599
and Agaorg Rasha from Vienna.

185
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,516
- That's right.

186
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,019
- Agaorg Rasha.

187
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,021
Didn't I read about him in the newspaper?

188
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,440
Wasn't he killed in a
restaurant last night?

189
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,858
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

190
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,736
Now, what's more, this came this morning.

191
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,326
- "If you want your clients'
secret bank accounts

192
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,287
to remain secret, you will
pay us 10 million francs.

193
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,872
Wait for instructions."

194
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,792
- I can't impress the point
too strongly, Mr. Christopher,

195
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,169
that there must be no publicity.

196
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,838
We cannot afford a scandal.

197
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,964
(Franz knocks)
Yes.

198
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,591
- Sorry, Herr Hurtil,

199
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,677
but Mr. Hayes is another of the victims.

200
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,181
- Hello, Bobby.

201
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,682
- What's he doing here?

202
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,517
- Do you know each other?

203
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,436
- Yeah, well, not socially.

204
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
- Answer me.

205
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,065
- The bank has retained Mr. Christopher

206
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,525
to protect its clients, Mr. Hayes.

207
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,818
- Protect us?

208
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,281
What are you, crazy?

209
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,325
He's US Justice Department.

210
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,369
- Not anymore, Bobby, not
for a couple of years.

211
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,745
- Get him outta here.

212
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,372
You hear me?

213
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,541
Swiss banks don't give up
their clients' numbers.

214
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,001
Not for nobody.

215
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,253
You got some friends back
home been looking for you.

216
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,089
You know that, don't you?

217
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,967
They'd like to pay you back
for all you've done for 'em.

218
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,136
They got a long memory.

219
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,390
All right, I'm leaving this bank right now

220
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,727
and I'm making a long distance
phone call, person to person.

221
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,189
My guess is if you are
not out of this town

222
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,108
by this time tomorrow,

223
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,027
they're gonna find you
in the nearest meat house

224
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,947
along with the other dead pigs.

225
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,661
Justice.

226
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,954
That's all I need.

227
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,917
- I must apologize for our
client, Mr. Christopher.

228
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,211
Won't you sit down?

229
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,214
This is my vice president, Mr. Benninger.

230
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,716
- Hello, Mr. Benninger.
- Hello.

231
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,758
- Do you know this man Hayes?

232
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,176
- Yes, I know him, he's a crook.

233
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,720
His partner is worse.

234
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,265
- That threat, you think he was serious?

235
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,184
- Yes, he was serious.

236
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,024
Oh, what are Mr. Hayes's problems
besides the obvious ones?

237
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,235
- Here.

238
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,949
- So Mr. Hayes is victim number five?

239
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:15,867
- Yes.

240
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,037
- This his own numbered account?

241
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,038
- That is correct.

242
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,914
- What does this represent?

243
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,666
- Give your attention to the deposits

244
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,668
and withdrawals on both accounts.

245
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,591
- It looks like he's taking
money from this account

246
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,135
and putting it in this account.

247
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,136
- Again, correct.

248
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,556
I found out about this just very recently.

249
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,266
He invests the funds that he borrowed

250
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,060
and keeps the profits for himself.

251
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,730
Unfortunately, at present,
he's heavily in debt

252
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:50,318
to account number 763421 , as you can see.

253
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,028
- Bad investments.

254
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,572
- I'm afraid that we don't
have that information.

255
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,788
- I see, well, if account 761 3421 belongs

256
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,458
to who I think it belongs to,
Bobby Hayes is ridiculous.

257
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,210
He's not a beginner.

258
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,545
He knows what his
associates will do to him

259
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,047
if they find out about it.

260
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,174
That's his problem.

261
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,343
This one's ours, isn't it?

262
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,055
Blackmailers want 10
million francs from the bank

263
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:24,185
and 1 million francs
from each of the victims,

264
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,645
five so far.

265
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,148
1 5 million francs, right?

266
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,859
- If we exclude the unfortunate Rasha.

267
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,572
- No, the price will stay the
same, that was only a warning.

268
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,491
So 1 5 million francs, that's what?

269
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,993
Approximately 6 million American dollars?

270
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,746
They must think you'll all pay, why?

271
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,334
Because you can't go to the police,

272
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,087
the scandal would be public in 24 hours.

273
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,340
Not very good advertising
for a proper Swiss bank.

274
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,136
And because the
blackmailers have five names

275
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,887
that go with five numbered accounts

276
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,431
and information about those accounts

277
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,434
that the five don't want exposed.

278
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,772
Who could have put the
names and numbers together?

279
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,316
- Well, that's quite obvious, isn't it?

280
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,735
- Is it?

281
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,611
- Well, of course.

282
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,198
These five people must have
been incredibly careless.

283
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,952
- Nobody's careless with
a secret numbered account.

284
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,998
Especially in the case of Bobby Hayes.

285
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:27,832
And gentlemen,

286
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,625
if I wanted to put the
names and numbers together,

287
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,336
I'd come to Zurich right
here to Hurtil Bank.

288
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,463
I'd find somebody in your organization

289
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,258
who had access to the
names and the numbers.

290
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,804
Now, who do you suppose
that somebody could be?

291
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,432
- Well, I suppose I could put the names

292
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,725
and numbers together.

293
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,395
- You're suspect number one.

294
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,190
- The second and most
likely suspect would be me.

295
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,861
Our master list is kept in
our vault, a special safe.

296
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,780
Only I have the combination.

297
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,782
- You're suspect number two.

298
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,702
That it?

299
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,955
- We Swiss are a cautious people.

300
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,376
- Obviously not cautious enough.

301
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,129
Hurtil, have your
secretary make appointments

302
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,299
with Mr. Kosta and Mr. McGowan.

303
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,593
So Denise Abbott's expecting my call

304
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,929
and Bobby Hayes doesn't want to talk to me

305
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,848
and Mr. Rasha is dead.

306
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,682
I guess that's it.

307
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,185
I'll send you a letter stating
the terms of my employment.

308
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,562
If you agree, I'll be
working for Hurtil Bank.

309
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,190
- Very kind of you to come.

310
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,441
I know we're in trouble,

311
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,735
but I'm confident that you can help us.

312
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,195
- [David] I'm doing my best.

313
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,785
- [Franz] I hope his best is good enough.

314
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,170
- Car for Korsak.

315
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,755
- When was the booking made?

316
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,673
- Today.

317
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,757
Yesterday.

318
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,926
What the hell, it was
last night Chicago time.

319
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,552
- Oh, yes, I have it.

320
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,346
A package was left here for you.

321
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,430
- I'll take that.

322
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,849
- Alright, Mr. Korsak,

323
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,268
would you please sign at the bottom, sir?

324
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,395
I already have your other details.

325
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,896
How long do you need the car?

326
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,606
- Not long.

327
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,069
- And here are the keys
for the silver gray BMW

328
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,696
and you’ll find it at the end of the hall,

329
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,572
through the door in our parking lot.

330
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,324
- Thank you, honey.

331
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,409
- [Cashier] Goodbye.

332
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,467
(engine rumbles)

333
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,559
(phone buzzes)

334
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,859
- David Christopher and associates,

335
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,028
consultant on international affairs.

336
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:02,945
May I help you?

337
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,240
- When in the hell did
I acquire associates?

338
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,075
- I'm just practicing, darling,

339
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,202
for when you make me your partner.

340
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,121
Besides, it sounds more legitimate.

341
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,080
- The only thing illegitimate

342
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,541
in that office is you, Corinne.

343
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,251
Hey, grab a pencil, will you?

344
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,420
- You are so old fashioned, David.

345
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,089
It's the electronic age now, you know.

346
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,091
- Yeah, all right, turn
on the damn machine.

347
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,593
- It's on, sir.

348
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,679
- Get ahold of Jack Foley
at the Justice Department

349
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,306
in Washington DC.

350
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,059
Tell him I want some
information on a Dwight McGowan.

351
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,770
He's a Texan, but he runs
his business out of LA.

352
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,106
And ask him if Luigi Vasili has got

353
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,192
any of his people coming
in and outta Zurich,

354
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,360
and if so, why?

355
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,571
Next, get ahold of Freddy
Cohen in Paris, honey.

356
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,199
If you can't remember
the number, look it up.

357
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,410
I want some information on the following.

358
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,995
- It is bad news, isn't it?

359
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,331
- No, not necessarily so.

360
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,501
It's just unexpected
complication, that's all.

361
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,920
- Then you mean all of our
planning's just out the window.

362
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,797
- Please relax, Rita.

363
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,591
You make me very nervous.

364
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,552
Come on, sit down, have
a drink, and listen.

365
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,805
- Yes, sit down, have a drink, and listen.

366
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,972
And relax.

367
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,227
Franz, everything depended on today.

368
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,938
We have very little time,
Franz, don't you see?

369
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,148
I know what it is.

370
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,359
The bank doesn't want to pay.

371
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,027
That's it, isn't it?

372
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,987
We won't get the money.

373
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,449
- Now, Rita, for God's sake,
this is getting ridiculous.

374
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,537
Please, try to control yourself.

375
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,705
- I'm sorry.

376
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,129
- I love you, remember?

377
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,048
- I love you too.

378
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,928
But I have this terrible feeling.

379
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,347
What was it, Franz?

380
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,682
- What was what?

381
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,517
- The unexpected complication.

382
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,570
- A consultant called David
Christopher has been hired

383
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,487
by the bank.

384
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,073
He's a very clever man.

385
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,535
We must find a way to deal with him.

386
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,664
(car honks)

387
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,090
(phone rings)

388
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,097
- Hello?

389
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,599
- [Denise] Mr. Christopher?

390
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,475
- [David] Yeah, who's this?

391
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,476
- Denise Abbott.

392
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,686
I'm sorry to disturb you,

393
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,899
but something rather urgent has come up.

394
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,108
- [David] What happened?

395
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,861
- I'll tell you when you get here.

396
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,071
- Alright, I'll be at the
Bellevue in about 20 minutes.

397
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,073
Is that all right?

398
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,743
- Yes, that will be okay.

399
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,497
There is plenty of parking.

400
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,213
(engine rumbles)

401
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,301
(suspenseful music)

402
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,456
(gun fires)

403
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,293
(suspenseful music)

404
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,388
(gun fires)

405
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,692
(water splashes)

406
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,082
(steam hisses)

407
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,298
(fists smack)

408
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,599
(groans)

409
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,942
(head thumps)

410
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,119
(groans)

411
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:06,665
(police speaking in foreign language)

412
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,633
(people shout)

413
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:35,027
(police speaking in foreign language)

414
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,287
- Hotel St. Gallen.

415
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,877
(police speaking in foreign language)

416
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,630
- Captain Hans Frey with federal police.

417
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,341
What's going on here?

418
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,010
- Some guy took a shot
at me, ran out that door.

419
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,053
- What's your name, please?

420
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,012
- Oh, I'm Christopher.

421
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,263
- Do you have a passport or something?

422
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,264
- Yeah.

423
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,182
- Please.

424
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,476
Thank you.

425
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
- He's about medium height.

426
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,688
He had on a blue raincoat and a dark hat.

427
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,733
- American, huh?

428
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,402
Swiss resident.

429
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,112
Businessman.

430
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,322
What is your business, Mr. Christopher?

431
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,157
- I'm a consultant.

432
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,203
They took a shot at me down there,

433
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,164
we had a fight, and he lost
his gun somewhere over there.

434
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,166
- Schwand?
- Yeah.

435
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,751
- Come over here.

436
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,628
See if you can find a gun.

437
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,588
- [Schwand] Okay.

438
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,631
- Look, Captain, I had an appointment

439
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,426
about a half an hour ago with
a client at the Bellevue.

440
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,553
- Who in Zurich is consulting you?

441
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,056
- Hurtil Bank.

442
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:46,974
- On what?

443
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,351
- Business.

444
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,269
- Business?

445
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,397
Are you registered at the hotel?

446
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,314
- 709.

447
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,316
- Who was he?

448
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,485
- The man with the...

449
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,403
- Yeah, the man.

450
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,572
- I don't know, I didn't
get that good a look at him.

451
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,449
I was pretty busy.
- Mm.

452
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,327
You've just given me a
fairly detailed description,

453
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,705
Mr. Christopher, so you weren't that busy.

454
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,000
- Captain, there is no gun, but the hat.

455
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:15,794
- So?

456
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,754
- Well, he did take a shot at me.

457
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,588
Now, they must have heard the shot.

458
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,756
Look, I don't have a gun.

459
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,926
- For the moment, Mr.
Christopher, you may go,

460
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,721
but I think we shall meet again.

461
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,183
I'm in charge of the
federal bank detail, Zurich.

462
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,023
(engines rumble)

463
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,375
(door thumps)

464
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,224
(suspenseful music)

465
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,355
(tires squeal)

466
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,526
(car crashes)

467
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,863
- Head him off!

468
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,119
(tires squeal)

469
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,883
(gun fires)

470
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,107
(tires squeal)

471
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,693
(car crashes)

472
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,949
(suspenseful music)

473
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,338
(crowd shouts)

474
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,352
(tires squeal)

475
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,771
(gun fires)

476
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,786
(car crashes)

477
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,596
(water splashes)

478
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,460
(gun fires)

479
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,423
(dumpster rattles)

480
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,385
(dumpster crashes)

481
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,064
(gun fires)

482
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,941
(Robert gasps)

483
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,944
(attacker screams)

484
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,614
(shovel clangs)

485
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,369
(gun fires)

486
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,873
(Robert gasps)

487
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,800
(foot smacks)

488
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,346
(Robert groans)

489
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,403
(Robert gasps)

490
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,884
(calm music)

491
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,306
(guests chatter)

492
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,230
(water splashes)

493
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,343
(doorbell rings)

494
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,772
(David knocks)

495
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,027
- [Denise] Who is it?

496
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,321
- Denise Abbott?

497
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,032
- [Denise] Who are you?

498
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,826
- David Christopher, you phoned me.

499
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,500
- You're late.

500
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:32,045
I didn't think you were coming.

501
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,298
I was taking a bath.

502
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,677
Come in, please.

503
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,935
Please, sit down.

504
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,522
I'll change into something
less comfortable.

505
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,692
Make yourself a drink.

506
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,068
I'll drink what you drink.

507
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,741
(singing in foreign language)

508
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:32,314
(singing in foreign language)

509
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,078
Do you speak German?

510
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,706
- No.

511
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,500
- It doesn't matter.

512
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,669
Personally, I never listen to the words.

513
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,296
What are we drinking?

514
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,422
- Scotch okay?

515
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,381
- Scotch is fine.

516
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,675
Do you?

517
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,677
- Do I what?

518
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,887
- Listen to the words?

519
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,139
- No, no.

520
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,517
- I suppose it's too gauche or something

521
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,978
to admit that in these days

522
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,315
of the philosopher minstrel
telling us all about life,

523
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,984
but frankly I don't give a damn.

524
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,569
Here's to your quest.

525
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,487
- Here's to it.

526
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,368
You said it was urgent.

527
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,371
- You said 20 minutes.

528
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,081
- Yeah, want to apologize about that.

529
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,458
I ran into a curious policeman.

530
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,960
- [Denise] I must admit, I'm curious too.

531
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,544
- About what?

532
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:41,424
- Mr. Hurtil called to assure
me that this very clever man,

533
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:45,845
Mr. Christopher, was now
handling my situation.

534
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,807
- Yeah, Hurtil's been a banker too long.

535
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:52,269
He uses words like situation
when he means blackmail.

536
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,688
- Are you very clever, Mr. Christopher?

537
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,565
- Well, that depends on who you talk to.

538
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,778
- I was also told I...

539
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:06,866
I'm not the only one
involved in this situation.

540
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,159
- No, there are others.

541
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,371
- And you will investigate them all,

542
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,707
look in their closets and find skeletons?

543
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,042
- Well, show me a closet.

544
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,466
- Why would Mr. Hurtil
hire you to protect me?

545
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,177
- Why not?

546
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,430
- Well, for one thing to say,

547
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,349
you've been with United
States Justice Department?

548
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,270
Then left rather abruptly,
if that's the word,

549
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,481
to make a home in Switzerland.

550
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,649
- [David] So?

551
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,486
- So one wonders what you've got to hide.

552
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,282
- I thought we were going
to talk about your problem.

553
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,995
You have something you want
to ask me or talk to me about,

554
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,705
you just go right ahead.

555
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:56,958
- Sorry.

556
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,336
Just testing.

557
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,380
Yeah, there is something
that's really bothering me.

558
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,717
Something I want to talk to you about.

559
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,095
How many accounts, secret that is,

560
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,347
would there be at Hurtil Bank?

561
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,975
- I don't know, a thousand, I guess.

562
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,061
- That's it, that's just it.

563
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:20,231
If there are, why would
you pick the ones like me?

564
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,442
Only someone inside the bank-

565
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,569
- Ones like you?

566
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,987
- The ones with skeletons.

567
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,405
- And skeleton have a name?

568
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,285
- James Ashwood.

569
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,828
Lord James Ashwood.

570
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,665
- And Lord James doesn't want
his name in the paper, huh?

571
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,627
- Wouldn’t be helpful to his career

572
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,880
or agreeable to his wife.

573
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:44,964
- You and Lord James would-

574
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,508
- No, it's been over now for some time.

575
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,759
- But the blackmailer is thinking

576
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,928
it'd still make good reading.

577
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,304
- I suppose so.

578
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,431
(phone rings)

579
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,724
There.

580
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,642
Excuse me.

581
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,480
Yeah, what is it?

582
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,440
Oh, Mr. Christopher.

583
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,441
Yes, it's for you.

584
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,071
A certain Captain Frey, I think he said.

585
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,448
- Hello, how'd you find me?

586
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,575
Yes, I know the Swiss
police are very efficient.

587
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,535
What do you want?

588
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,955
The hell would I want with a rented car?

589
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,791
(engine rumbles)

590
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,551
Now what in the hell is
all this about a Hertz car?

591
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,552
I don't need a Hertz car.

592
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,220
I got a car, you see it?

593
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,347
- The man wore a Hertz uniform.

594
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,224
He stated the car was ordered by you.

595
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,143
He mentioned your room number.

596
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,060
- The package, Captain.

597
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,312
- And he said that the package
you wanted delivered is

598
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,439
in the trunk.

599
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,441
Shall we examine this package?

600
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,317
- I suppose if I said I
didn't want to, you'd insist.

601
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,193
- Yes, I insist.

602
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,111
Shall we go?

603
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,291
All right.

604
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,293
Here, please.

605
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,340
(dramatic music)

606
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,354
(machine whirs)

607
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,359
(paper tears)

608
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,875
(phone rings)

609
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,756
- Hello.

610
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,382
- It's 11 o'clock, you've overslept.

611
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,593
- I was up half the night
with the Zurich police

612
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,346
who insist I'm responsible
for a Bobby Hayes

613
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,765
that was stuffed into a
trunk of a rented car,

614
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,517
which they say I rented,
which I didn't rent,

615
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,310
now don't further complicate my life.

616
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,144
What is it?

617
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,521
- Did you escape?

618
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,355
- No, no.

619
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,815
I didn't sign for the car.

620
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,150
They let me go.

621
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,485
- I don't understand.

622
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,487
- Never mind, get to the point.

623
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,822
- Jack Foley said there was trouble.

624
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,491
- What kind of trouble?

625
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,701
- [Corinne] Two men, a Korsak and Sando,

626
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,411
employees of Luigi Vasili,

627
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,039
left Chicago in a hurry night before last,

628
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,792
destination Zurich.

629
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,626
- Well, they did their thing.

630
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,045
They're probably halfway home by now.

631
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,129
Unless they stay on.

632
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,047
- Unless what?

633
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,174
- Oh, nothing, never mind.

634
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,008
Go on.

635
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,719
- Well, let's start with Rasha.

636
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,848
Now Freddy says he's a Czech or Bulgarian.

637
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,517
One of those.

638
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,186
An arms dealer specialized
in selling old weapons

639
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:49,023
to new countries and
really ripping them off.

640
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,358
And they swore to get him.

641
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,986
Freddy says it's only a matter of time.

642
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,820
- Yeah, well, Freddy's right,

643
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,738
only his time ran out yesterday.

644
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,700
What else you got?

645
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,954
- [Corinne] Well, so far
Hurtil and Benninger have

646
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,414
a clean bill of health.

647
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:09,669
Jack Foley said he's
mailing you a file on Hayes.

648
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,714
I've sent a messenger with
a dossier on Denise Abbott

649
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,215
to your hotel.

650
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,216
Let's see.

651
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,803
That just leaves Mr. Texas.

652
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,728
(guests chatter)

653
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,160
- Dwight McGowan?

654
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,786
- David Christopher?

655
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:44,704
- That's right.

656
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,374
- How about sharing some of
this back home whiskey with me?

657
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,500
- Beer is fine.

658
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,920
- Waiter, waiter.

659
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,798
Bring my friend here a nice cold beer.

660
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,511
Well, Davey, I've been wondering

661
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,764
when you're going to
get around old Dwight.

662
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,766
Herr Hurtil tells me
you're gonna be my knight

663
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,019
in shining armor and keep
those bastards off my back.

664
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,730
- Same message to the
Internal Revenue Service?

665
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,900
- You've been talking to
someone about me, boy?

666
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,777
- They volunteered the information.

667
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,905
- You sure are a quiet one, David boy.

668
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,198
But now don't you worry.

669
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:25,828
I got me a deal simmering back
in LA that'll set me flying.

670
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,373
Those tax claims, peanuts.

671
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,667
Old Dwight and his Uncle Sammy just has

672
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,669
a little disagreement
over some back taxes.

673
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,628
Nothing serious.

674
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,088
- Well, old Dwight,

675
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,757
I'd be a liar if I said
they weren't concerned.

676
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,469
- My old daddy used to say,
"Son, don't you lose your head

677
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,055
because your ass is sure to follow."

678
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,891
- You wanna translate that for me?

679
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,601
- Well, let me say it this way.

680
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,063
You take care of this blackmail bullshit

681
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,524
and I'll take care of my
Uncle Sammy, you hear?

682
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,111
- How well did you know Hayes and Rasha?

683
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,155
How about Kosta, Denise Abbott?

684
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,366
- Oh, I didn't know 'em.

685
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,411
Herr Hurtil mentioned 'em to
me, but I never knew 'em, boy.

686
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,205
- Who handled your account?

687
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,498
- [Dwight] Me.

688
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,667
- How about your wife, she know about it?

689
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,420
- Oh, little lady and I have
been divorced for nine years.

690
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,046
- Secretary, business manager?

691
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,215
- Nobody.

692
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,386
I guard those papers with my life, boy.

693
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,846
See, I'm scared, Davey.

694
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,140
I don't have much more time.

695
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,476
I'm getting on and I can't
afford any big setbacks.

696
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,230
- Well, Mac, money ain't everything.

697
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,399
- You trying to tell me something, Davey?

698
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,361
- Yeah, five little secret
accounts came to Zurich.

699
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,029
Hayes was killed and then there were four.

700
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,574
Rasha was killed and
then there were three.

701
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,368
You show up and your daddy
might turn out to be right.

702
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,290
- Hello, Rita Jensen.

703
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,833
- Rita, it's Franz.

704
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,667
- Everything all right?

705
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,710
- So far so good.

706
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,003
I've set it up.

707
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,297
Just a matter of following through.

708
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,548
- What's the plan?

709
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,799
- Just as we discussed.

710
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,260
Now you know what to do.

711
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,972
Meet me tomorrow morning just before noon

712
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,474
at the entrance of the park.

713
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,143
All right?

714
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,269
Auf wiedersehen.

715
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,645
- [Rita] Auf wiedersehen.

716
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,362
- Good morning.

717
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,623
Good morning.

718
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,509
(door thumps)

719
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,220
(paper rustles)

720
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,266
- Herr Kosta, this is Mr. Christopher.

721
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,643
As I told you on the telephone,

722
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,395
we've retained him to protect us and you.

723
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,774
These seem to be the final instructions.

724
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,527
"The day after tomorrow,
your Mr. Christopher."

725
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,153
They know you.

726
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,989
"With 1 5 million francs in uncut diamonds

727
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,325
accompanied by the account
holders will proceed

728
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,787
to Wilderswil to the first
intersection past Interlaken.

729
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:17,500
There, you will find a car
parked next to a wooden barn

730
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,502
with further instructions.

731
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:23,631
No surveillance or all lives are forfeit."

732
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,466
- It's gonna be a hell of a crowd.

733
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,634
Can you get the diamonds?

734
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,220
- We have a supply in the vault.

735
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,347
- How about you, Mr. Kosta?

736
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,307
Are you gonna come up with the money?

737
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,476
- Why should I pay a million franks?

738
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,563
I did not break security, the bank did.

739
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,231
- You have evidence?

740
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,275
- Evidence?
- Evidence, facts, proof.

741
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,735
- How else could it have happened?

742
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,736
- No evidence.

743
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,071
- Actually, Mr. Christopher,

744
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,074
Herr Benninger and I have
discussed this matter

745
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,909
and we reached the
conclusion that the bank,

746
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,037
without admitting any
irresponsibility, will pay the ransom

747
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,623
in order to save the lives of our clients.

748
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,127
Especially after the dreadful
death of Mr. Hayes last night,

749
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,837
I can't risk another life.

750
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:11,137
- That's very noble of you, Herr Hurtil.

751
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,181
- We realize this is a temporary solution,

752
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,933
that the reputation of
the bank is worth more

753
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,518
than 1 5 million francs.

754
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,395
- And the bank will make up its losses

755
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,814
with additional charges to its customers.

756
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,066
- The percentage of loss
will have very little effect

757
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,527
in the charges of the customers.

758
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,696
- No wonder they thought you might pay.

759
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,698
- We'll pay, just this once.

760
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,158
That's why we hired you.

761
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,619
We do not like the possibility

762
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,787
of further loss along these lines.

763
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,665
- I see.

764
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,294
Mr. Kosta, I'd like to talk to you.

765
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:45,755
- What are you after?

766
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,256
- The bank has hired me

767
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,592
to protect its clients from blackmail.

768
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:52,386
I just wanna know why
you're being blackmailed.

769
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,096
- Isn't that academic now?

770
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,140
The Hurtil Bank has agreed

771
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,601
to follow the blackmailer’s
final instructions

772
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,436
and pay their demands.

773
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,189
Your job now, it seems to me,

774
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,942
is to see that these
instructions are carried out.

775
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,195
I must go now.

776
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,114
Herr Hurtil, may I thank you
for your gracious handling

777
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,283
of a most difficult situation.

778
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,452
Auf wiedersehen.
- Auf wiedersehen.

779
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,629
Well, as you pointed
out, we have no evidence.

780
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,131
And at this moment, I have no choice.

781
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,427
(engine rumbles)

782
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,647
- I spoke to Mr. Hurtil.

783
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,148
He says there's a ransom to pay.

784
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,401
- Yeah, that's what I
want to talk to you about.

785
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,444
- Good.

786
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,362
Follow me.

787
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,116
(engine rumbles)

788
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,537
(upbeat music)

789
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,526
(upbeat music continues)

790
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,296
(tires squeal)

791
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,799
(upbeat music)

792
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,591
(tires squeal)

793
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,439
(engines rumble)

794
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,912
(tires squeal)

795
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,296
(engine rumbles)

796
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,114
I'm so sorry.

797
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,449
- It's all this stupid job.

798
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,562
(Denise sighs)

799
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,438
What?

800
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,195
- I must tell you something.

801
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,697
- You're married and
have 1 0 children, right?

802
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,366
- (laughs) No.

803
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,911
I'm serious.

804
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,581
- I'm not.

805
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,498
- No, please.

806
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,129
I want to make a confession.

807
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,256
- Do I look like a priest?

808
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,138
- Look like the man I just made love to.

809
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,890
- Good, now that you confess-

810
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,892
- No, no, please.

811
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,605
- Okay, confess, confess.

812
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,527
- My father...

813
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,364
My father-

814
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,198
- Your father was a drunk.

815
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,366
So was mine, so what?

816
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,662
- You know about that?

817
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,580
- Yeah, I know about it.

818
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,290
- You know the rest?

819
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,458
- Most of it.

820
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,920
Your mother ran away
when your father died.

821
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,965
You were brought up in a convent.

822
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,676
You ran away from the
convent when you were 17.

823
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,595
You worked as a model, a waitress-

824
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,513
- Mistress.

825
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,892
- And my information
is that it wasn't work.

826
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:32,810
You were in love.

827
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:33,727
- Mm.

828
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,940
I told you about Jamie.

829
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,483
- Don't tell about Jamie.

830
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,068
- I told you it was over.

831
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,404
- Told me it was over.

832
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,322
- You don't care?

833
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,865
- You said it was over.

834
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,827
- Yeah, it is.

835
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:55,416
He went back to his wife,
his children, and his career.

836
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:04,508
(kisses) End of the confession.

837
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:05,843
- Now it's my turn.

838
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,805
- Do you want to confess?

839
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,723
- Yeah.

840
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,269
I would like

841
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,565
a cup of coffee.

842
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,734
(Denise laughs)

843
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:22,651
- Alright.

844
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,112
- Later.

845
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,414
(car honks)

846
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,083
(tires squeal)

847
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,441
- Get on that boat.

848
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,573
(Rita speaking in foreign language)

849
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:12,409
(engine rumbles)

850
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,246
(upbeat music)

851
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,693
(upbeat music continues)

852
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,598
(upbeat music continues)

853
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:46,587
(upbeat music continues)

854
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,563
(water splashes)

855
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,001
- Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late.

856
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,252
I got held up in traffic.

857
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,338
- I'm afraid you made a mistake.

858
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,590
- It's no mistake, my
name is David Christopher.

859
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,511
- I don't know any David
Christopher, I'm sorry.

860
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,846
- I'm very big on secrets.

861
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,225
Any friend of Franz Benninger
is a friend of mine.

862
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,980
- And what big secret do you
know about me, Mr. Christopher?

863
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:47,856
- Well, call me David.

864
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,067
I'll call you, what'll I call you?

865
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,110
- For somebody that big on secrets,

866
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,071
I'm surprised you don't know.

867
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,365
(waiter speaking in foreign language)

868
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,282
(David speaking in foreign language)

869
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,116
- Nothing, thank you.

870
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,034
- Oh, nothing.

871
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,203
Now, Miss, Miss what?

872
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,120
- Jensen.

873
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,747
My name is Rita Jensen.

874
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:04,581
- Rita Jensen.

875
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,791
- And it's not a very big secret.

876
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,626
And if you would excuse me, please.

877
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,809
- [Franz] What will you have?

878
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,477
- Oh, I don't care.

879
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,062
Campari soda, anything.

880
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,023
- Campari soda from
madam and vodka for me,

881
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,817
ice twist of lemon.

882
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,528
- We're in trouble, Franz.

883
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:35,696
- In what trouble?

884
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,198
- That man, David
Christopher, saw us together.

885
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,534
- When?

886
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,619
- In front of the bank, I suppose.

887
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,745
He followed me.

888
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:45,956
- What?

889
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,708
- [Waiter] Would you
like to order now, sir?

890
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:48,667
- No thank you.

891
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,585
Later, thanks.

892
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,087
What did you tell him?

893
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,005
- Nothing.

894
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,049
- What did he say?

895
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,344
- He said, "Any friend
of Franz Benninger is

896
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,470
a friend of mine."

897
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,978
- Franz Benninger, my own vice president?

898
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,730
It can't be.

899
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,732
I simply cannot believe it.

900
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,400
- That's my information.

901
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,154
(phone buzzes)

902
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,155
- Yes?

903
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,865
- [Secretary] Mr. Christopher, please.

904
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,491
- For you.

905
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,409
- Hello.

906
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,327
I’ll wait.

907
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,454
- [Franz] Franz Benninger,

908
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,080
I would very much like to meet you.

909
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,290
- Yes, when?

910
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,666
- [Franz] At the (indistinct).

911
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:30,500
- When?

912
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,710
- [Franz] At (indistinct).

913
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,128
- I'll be there.

914
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,423
Franz Benninger.

915
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,507
He wants to meet me.

916
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,184
- He's coming outta the bank.

917
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:50,270
(suspenseful music)

918
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,197
(engine rumbles)

919
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,367
(bell clangs)

920
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,328
(car honks)

921
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:53,166
(announcer speaking in foreign language)

922
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:01,383
(crowd chatters)

923
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:10,183
(suspenseful music)

924
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:35,667
(announcer speaking in foreign language)

925
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,002
- Hey, come on.

926
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:41,381
(suspenseful music)

927
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:02,611
(gun fires)
(Rita gasps)

928
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,993
(dramatic music)

929
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:17,125
(officers speaking in foreign language)

930
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,924
(gun fires)

931
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:26,718
(dramatic music)

932
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:43,944
- Stop.

933
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,779
Stop, stop or I fire!

934
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:49,199
(gun fires)

935
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,579
(train rattles)

936
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,919
(brake squeals)

937
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:10,428
- You deny that you and Benninger
had no part of blackmail?

938
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,180
- Blackmail?

939
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,932
That's ridiculous.

940
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,184
You are talking about blackmail?

941
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,770
You have known Franz for over 30 years.

942
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,939
You think he would stoop to blackmail?

943
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,941
- The two of you have
been up to something.

944
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:23,775
What is it?

945
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,652
- It was my fault, everything.

946
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:27,904
My father died two months ago.

947
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:31,199
He had, I would say, a very good business.

948
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:34,244
But lately he had trouble,
financial trouble.

949
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:37,289
- But what has all this got
to do with Herr Benninger?

950
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,791
- Well, my father had his
numbered account in your bank,

951
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,793
so I made an appointment
with Mr. Benninger

952
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,630
and he said without the proper papers,

953
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,924
he could not hand over the account to me.

954
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:48,967
- That's correct.

955
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:54,848
- Well, then I saw Mr.
Benninger quite a lot of times

956
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,727
and we fell in love

957
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:01,897
and he decided to turn over
the numbered account to me.

958
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,941
And then with all these
murders happening, I mean,

959
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:08,069
we were afraid that if the
case would not get solved

960
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,280
and if David Christopher
could not solve it,

961
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:13,283
everything would be
lost, so we had to hurry.

962
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,368
And he turned over the account to me

963
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,872
and I in turn paid off the
loan and the debt of my father.

964
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,541
- And he did this without consulting me?

965
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,419
- Yes, Mr. Hurtil, without consulting you.

966
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:29,674
You see, Franz didn't think
he was doing anything wrong.

967
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,468
The money was legally mine.

968
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:33,720
I'm the only heir.

969
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:34,971
And believe me, Mr. Hurtil,

970
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,223
it did pain him to go behind your back.

971
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,767
It really did.

972
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:42,479
But you see, he loved me
and he wanted to help me.

973
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,606
And I loved him.

974
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,983
- Excuse me.

975
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,568
But I thought you would like to know

976
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,695
that Herr Benninger's condition is good.

977
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,448
He was very lucky.

978
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,366
- Thank you.

979
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,496
- Solves your problem, Herr Hurtil.

980
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,334
Tomorrow morning, give
your driver the diamonds.

981
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,002
Have him pick up McGowan and Kosta

982
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,046
and meet me at my hotel at eight o'clock.

983
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,172
I've got a plane to catch.

984
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:10,590
- But where are you going?

985
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,092
What about tomorrow morning?

986
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,928
- [David] I'll be back!

987
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,681
(plane rumbles)

988
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,859
(upbeat music)

989
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,216
- I just had a meeting
with David Christopher

990
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,551
at the airport.

991
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:55,593
- At the airport?

992
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,303
- Yes, at the airport.

993
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,473
We have a problem, Sergeant.

994
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,391
- We do?

995
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:08,314
- If we find that one of our
banks is being blackmailed

996
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,442
and a number of its clients are involved

997
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,486
with disclosures of their
secret numbered accounts,

998
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,907
complicated by the fact that
two of these clients have been,

999
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:23,121
shall we say, been terminated violently,

1000
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:27,792
major crimes have been committed.

1001
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,335
Murder and blackmail.

1002
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,756
So what should we do?

1003
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,550
- Captain, we must go to the
commissioner immediately.

1004
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,095
- Wrong, not immediately, but very soon.

1005
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,597
- I don't understand.

1006
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:44,559
- If we present an unfinished
equation to the commissioner,

1007
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,478
a problem without a solution,

1008
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,439
we have a scandal of major proportions.

1009
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,443
And that is one thing our
country does not need now.

1010
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,613
A major banking scandal.

1011
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:00,116
David Christopher is a very clever man.

1012
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,161
He told me a very interesting story.

1013
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:05,705
Fascinating.

1014
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,709
I've given him 24 hours.

1015
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,255
Come, Sergeant, we have work to do.

1016
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,216
- Where was he going?

1017
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,342
- [Frey] Who?

1018
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,259
- Christopher.

1019
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,678
- He didn't say.

1020
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,971
- [Schwand] But you know.

1021
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,599
- Yes, I know.

1022
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,561
Uncut diamonds.

1023
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,355
Yes, very clever.

1024
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,399
- Uncut diamonds?

1025
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,902
- High value in a small package.

1026
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:39,030
Easy to conceal, easy to market.

1027
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,532
Virtually untraceable.

1028
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:46,037
Yes, very smart, our Mr. Blackmailer.

1029
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,999
(upbeat music)

1030
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,183
- I just wanted to remind you, Captain,

1031
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:10,061
I'm gonna do this my way.

1032
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,689
- You do it your way, I'll do it my way.

1033
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,822
(Frey speaking in foreign language)

1034
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:26,995
- Good morning, sir.

1035
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,079
Cross is my name.

1036
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,874
Here are the diamonds.

1037
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,376
- We’ll pick up Ms.
Abbott at the Bellevue.

1038
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,294
- Yes, sir.

1039
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:38,756
(suspenseful music)

1040
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:08,912
(suspenseful music continues)

1041
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,352
- The autobahn, I'll
tell you when to get off.

1042
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:33,728
- [Driver] Very well, sir.

1043
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,064
- What's that?

1044
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,190
- Uncut diamonds.

1045
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,191
That's what they want,

1046
01:10:38,275 --> 01:10:40,151
the bank says that's what they’ll get.

1047
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,665
- [Denise] They don't look very pretty.

1048
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:01,881
(suspenseful music)

1049
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,995
(suspenseful music continues)

1050
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,142
(cow moos)

1051
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,773
(paper rustles)

1052
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:02,859
- "Go to Brienz,

1053
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:06,070
where the road to Caral
crosses the railroad tracks.

1054
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,364
A steam engine waits for you.

1055
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,408
Further instructions by the engineer."

1056
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,205
Let me check the car.

1057
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,214
Alright, McGowan, let's go.

1058
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,718
- I'm sorry, Davey boy,
this is as far as I go.

1059
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:29,677
I can't make it.

1060
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,596
- But the instruction says-

1061
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,056
- Yes, I know, they said all of us.

1062
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,808
- I'm sorry, Davey, I want no part of it.

1063
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,560
I'm a sick man.

1064
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:39,145
I've gone as far as I'm going.

1065
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,986
- Cross, you take Mr.
McGowan back to his hotel.

1066
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,404
He's not feeling well.

1067
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,530
- Very well, sir.

1068
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:56,829
- What happened?

1069
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:58,456
- He said he's sick.

1070
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,665
He's going back to the hotel.

1071
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,168
How is it?

1072
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:04,921
- One of the cylinders is
bad, points need adjustment,

1073
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:05,880
carburetor is dirty.

1074
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,173
Besides, she's stolen.

1075
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,260
No registration papers,
no insurance, nothing.

1076
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,433
(door thumps)

1077
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:27,193
(engine rumbles)

1078
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,590
(Frey speaking in foreign language)

1079
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,842
(officer speaking in foreign language)

1080
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,802
- This is Captain Frey.

1081
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,679
We are in Brienz approaching Interlaken

1082
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:57,223
and have just passed
the black Mercedes 600,

1083
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,975
going now toward Zurich.

1084
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:04,063
License number ZH5001 .

1085
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:08,192
Pick up and follow, but
do not interfere or stop.

1086
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,986
We'll contact later. Danke.

1087
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:13,865
- I think I recognized Herr
McGowan in the backseat.

1088
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,242
- Yes.

1089
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:17,160
So did I.

1090
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,958
(engine rumbles)

1091
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,424
- Oh, here is good.

1092
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:32,425
Yeah, here.

1093
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,389
Go right up to the front.

1094
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:40,308
This way.

1095
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,651
(train whistle blows)

1096
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,240
(train chugs)

1097
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,520
(train chugs)

1098
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:55,341
Go over to the ski lift platform.

1099
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,445
(officer speaking in foreign language)

1100
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,573
- [Officer] Aerial
surveillance has observed

1101
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,992
suspects boarding Interlaken's gateway.

1102
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:25,663
Will continue surveillance
until further notice, ended.

1103
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,134
(suspenseful music)

1104
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,615
(phone rings)

1105
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,123
- Hello?

1106
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,499
- Start the ski tow.

1107
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:14,670
Bring the diamonds up to
the top of the ski lift.

1108
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:16,589
The rest stay in plain sight.

1109
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:18,466
There is a rifle on each one of you.

1110
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:22,803
- What did he say?

1111
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,644
- Said I'm to bring the
diamonds to the top of the lift.

1112
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:34,857
You two are supposed
to stay in plain sight.

1113
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:36,233
- May I make a suggestion?

1114
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:38,486
- Go ahead.

1115
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,987
- You have no value to these people.

1116
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,906
They'll kill you without compunction.

1117
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,367
- But you think they won't kill you?

1118
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,326
- I have a value.

1119
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:48,746
I may be a future object of blackmail.

1120
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,790
And if they were foolish enough to try,

1121
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,376
I'm a fairly good shot myself.

1122
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:57,421
Allow me, Mr. Christopher.

1123
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,467
- Go ahead.

1124
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:18,067
(helicopter whirs)

1125
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:22,029
- Look.

1126
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:25,032
(helicopter whirs)

1127
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:47,471
- Let's go for a ride.

1128
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,057
- What are you doing?

1129
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,059
You're a bloody fool!

1130
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,645
(train chugs)

1131
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,032
- I am Captain Frey, police.

1132
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,828
Have you seen two men and a
woman, one man an American?

1133
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:14,373
- Yes, I just took them
up to the ski lift.

1134
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:17,376
I was given some money yesterday
and told to expect them.

1135
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,128
It was a joke he wanted to play

1136
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,464
on his American tourist friend.

1137
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:22,715
It was very funny.

1138
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:23,632
- A joke, huh?

1139
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:27,219
Can you show me exactly
what you did, please?

1140
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,513
- Yeah, I called him from the cab.

1141
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:36,937
Start the ski tow.

1142
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,939
Bring the diamonds up here.

1143
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,941
The rest stay in plain sight.

1144
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:43,194
There is a rifle on each of you.

1145
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,237
- He said there was a rifle on each of us.

1146
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:46,363
- You know what he said?

1147
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,866
He talked to me on the phone.

1148
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,536
- Why are you doing this?

1149
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,038
- I flew to London last night.

1150
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,956
I had a little talk with Lord James.

1151
01:19:58,668 --> 01:19:59,418
- Why did you do that?

1152
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:00,336
- Maybe I was jealous.

1153
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:04,381
- He denied I was his mistress?

1154
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,550
- No, he didn't deny it.

1155
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:08,552
But you left out the good part.

1156
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,846
Ever since he said goodbye,
you've been blackmailing him.

1157
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:11,680
He's tired of it.

1158
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,182
He told his wife, he told his children,

1159
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:15,684
he's gonna take his chances
with the newspapers.

1160
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,938
- What does that have to do with this?

1161
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:21,357
- Well, once a blackmailer,
always a blackmailer.

1162
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:23,984
We tried to figure out

1163
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:27,238
what could put four unlikely
characters like McGowan, Kosta,

1164
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,241
Rasha, and Hayes together,
and I came up with you, honey.

1165
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:35,287
Beautiful woman alone in Zurich
will do anything for money.

1166
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,873
- Even if it were true,
what does it prove?

1167
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:40,334
- Well, it proves that
nobody broke bank security.

1168
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,628
Nobody gave away any secret numbers.

1169
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:44,672
There are no mysterious blackmailers

1170
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:45,965
blackmailing all of you.

1171
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:48,425
You pooled your statements
and blackmailed each other.

1172
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,094
That's what it proves.

1173
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,763
- You have a lovely imagination, David.

1174
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,140
- You tell me where I went wrong then.

1175
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,686
- If nobody takes the diamonds,
then there is no crime.

1176
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,895
Not one you can prove.

1177
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,859
- You count two murders,
an attempt on my life

1178
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,151
as a misdemeanor?

1179
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:08,404
- Mr. Hayes was killed by
a gangster from Chicago.

1180
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:10,447
That's what I read in the newspaper.

1181
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,492
And poor Mr. Rasha was murdered
by his business associate

1182
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:15,035
whom he was cheating.

1183
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,204
- I suppose you didn't
try to kill me in the car.

1184
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:18,747
You didn't encourage Bobby Hayes

1185
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:19,999
to try to kill me in the garage.

1186
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,709
- I'm not responsible for Bobby Hayes

1187
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,128
and I'm not responsible for Mr. Kosta

1188
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,630
or for the very charming Mr. McGowan.

1189
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:31,135
(suspenseful music)

1190
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,724
(gun fires)

1191
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:51,780
(dramatic music)

1192
01:21:58,538 --> 01:21:59,914
(Denise gasps)

1193
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:02,750
(dramatic music)

1194
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,850
(gun fires)

1195
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:24,897
(helicopter whirs)

1196
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,453
(gun fires)

1197
01:22:53,259 --> 01:22:55,427
(screams)

1198
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,824
(suspenseful music)

1199
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:41,348
They can be ours.

1200
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,183
Yours and mine.

1201
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:45,310
If you want them.

1202
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,105
The blackmailer got them.

1203
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,773
He killed MacGowan and Kosta.

1204
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:52,484
He got away.

1205
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:54,570
Don't you see?

1206
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:57,781
Who loses, David?

1207
01:23:58,658 --> 01:23:59,491
The bank?

1208
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:02,077
Doesn't think of it.

1209
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,539
The bank has no morals.

1210
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:07,082
- Yeah, neither do you, lady.

1211
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:10,127
- I will have those, please.

1212
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:13,047
(footsteps pound)

1213
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:19,678
- Get the helicopter.
- Yes sir.

1214
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:26,894
- You have an affinity for
dead bodies, Mr. Christopher.

1215
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:28,312
- Yeah, that's true, Captain,

1216
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,856
but this time I've got an explanation.

1217
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,692
It's a little complicated,
but you're gonna love it.

1218
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,944
- Thank God you came in time, Inspector.

1219
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:39,490
This horrible man is
responsible for all this.

1220
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:43,202
He killed two men and he
was trying to kill me too.

1221
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,245
- You are safe now, Ms. Abbott.

1222
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:48,248
These are serious
charges, Mr. Christopher.

1223
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:49,416
You will return to Zurich

1224
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,418
in the custody of Sergeant Schwand

1225
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,796
while I escort Ms. Abbott.

1226
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,172
- Oh, that was the most,

1227
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,048
the most terrible experience in my life.

1228
01:24:56,132 --> 01:25:00,135
- Yes, yes, it must have
been very difficult for you.

1229
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,346
You won't forget to bring the diamonds,

1230
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,722
will you, Mr. Christopher?

1231
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:09,353
Now, Ms. Abbott, you'll
tell me the entire story.

1232
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:12,022
(solemn music)

1233
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:42,719
(solemn music continues)

1234
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:06,952
(upbeat music)

1235
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:14,251
(dramatic music)

1236
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:44,740
(dramatic music continues)

1237
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:15,103
(dramatic music continues)
