I am the Whistler.

00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,569
I know many things,
for I walk by night.

4
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,904
I know many strange tales,

5
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,615
many secrets hidden in
the hearts of men and women

6
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,492
who have stepped
into the shadows.

7
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,953
Yes, I know the nameless terrors

8
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,997
of which they dare not speak.

9
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,629
The man sitting alone
is a stranger here.

10
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,091
He has means and
a responsible position in society.

11
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,927
He's a man who is more at home
in a fashionable club

12
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,679
than in a waterfront bar.

13
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,222
But, tonight,
he is turned from

of his own world

-Mm-hmm.

Oh, you can talk.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

18
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,595
I've got a job for you.

19
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,681
Well, just what is it
you want done, Mister...?

20
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,183
Do you have to know my name?

21

No.

Oh.

25
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,193
Well, um...

26
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,445
What does this fella do?

27
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,280
Would that make any difference?

28
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,907
Yes, it makes a lot of difference.

29
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,993
You see, if he's important,
I won't touch it.

30
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,454
He's just a small manufacturer.

31
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,665
Oh, legitimate businessman, huh?

32
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,625
You see...

33
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,336
murder of a chap like that
will get a lot of publicity.

34
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,089
Well, if it's the money
you're thinking about,

35
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,548
I'm prepared to pay you well.

36
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,009
Take ten thousand to handle it.

37
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,513
You see, I have to split
with the gentleman

38
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,056
who actually does the work.

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,017
Of course, he'll never know
who's putting up the money.

40
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,644
And I don't want to know
who he is.

41

(CHUCKLING)
You won't.

42
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,357
What's the name and address
of the party?

43
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,668
Bring the money?

44
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,922
-Oh, you...
-You see, I'm not the type

45

and not deliver.

46

for those who work for me.

back there wants you.

53
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,562
-Say, I think the fella...
-He doesn't understand

54
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,689
a word you're saying, mister.
He's a deaf mute.

Oh.

56
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,464
Deliver this.

00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,924
You know where.

58
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,551

for that.

I've been awfully worried lately, sir.
I thought, perhaps, that you...

You mean you thought
I've been...

for oranges, sir.

and the house, sir?

about my absences?

After all, he is your partner.

143
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,055
Something's happened
to you, Earl. You're...

144
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,265
You're different.

145
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,391
If I seem less upset,

146
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,311
it's because I've become
reconciled to Clare's death.

147
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,772
You're wise to try and forget. I...

148
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,232
I think it's best that way.

149
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,401
Not much chance
of my forgetting.

150
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,361
My friends have taken care of that.

151
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,113
You dropped all your friends.

152
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,032
They'd changed.

153
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,575
They weren't the same
any longer.

154
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,493
Oh, you imagine that, Earl.

155
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,122
The trip was my idea.

156
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,917
It took a lot of persuading
to get Clare to go.

157
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,129
You see, something had happened
to our marriage.

158
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,674
We'd drifted apart,
even thought of separating.

159
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,093
-Why, I always thought...
-Yes, I know.

160
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,678
I didn't mention it
to you or McNear

161
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,599
because I didn't want to bring
my domestic troubles into the office.

162
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,060
I talked Clare
into making the trip.

163
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,064
I'd even hoped that it might
bring us together again.

164
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,109
Most of our friends knew
that we were having trouble.

165
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,655
You'd imagine how they reacted
when I came back alone.

166
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,114
No.

167
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,617
She was in my arms
in the water.

168
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,995
I let go of her to reach for
a raft that was floating past.

169
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,164
When I looked back,
she was gone.

170
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,041
But you helped
other people onto the raft.

171
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,960
Well, that's exactly the point.

172
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,878
Our friends have been
wondering why I was unable

173
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,340
to get my wife on the raft
when I was able to help others.

174
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,801
Do you mean anyone
has suggested you...

175
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,261
you deliberately let Clare drown?

176
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,305
Oh, no. No-one has been
as crude as that.

177
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,433
But I've felt the accusation
in their eyes.

178
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,519
Oh, you're mistaken, Earl.
You must be mistaken.

You're not being fair to me.

187
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,048
I think we'd better come
to an understanding.

188
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,300
About what?

189
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,135
For months now,
you've been coming to the office

190
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,511
only once or twice a week,

191
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,263
and then for only
a couple of hours.

192
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,681
Well, I haven't been myself, Charlie.

193
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,224
Everything's gonna be all right now.

194
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,934
I know, Earl, I know, but...

195
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,894
you know I wouldn't have
invested my money

196
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,813
in a business
I know nothing about,

197
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,064
if you hadn't assured me

198
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,567
you were going to give it
all your attention.

199
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,986
Well, what would you do
if I had an accident?

200
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,113
-Well, I... I...
-I'll tell you what you'd do.

201
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,531
Absolutely nothing.

202
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,951
I've taught Miss Walker all there is
to know about this business.

203
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,786
And I'm leaving her
my share of the firm,

204
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,788

My, you have lovely offices.
My name is Smith.

213
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,689
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet
a successful businessman like you.

00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,608
One that's successful
and also accessible.

What can I do for you?

These are specimen policies, Mr Conrad.

219
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,826
I came to talk to you
about life insurance.

220

Oh, a little warm, isn't it?

221
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,829
I'm with the Atlantic Mutual,

222
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,749
and my company has developed
a very special type of policy

223
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,084
for a man in your position.

224
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,627
You can forget all the drivel.

Hurry up and get it over with.

00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,463
Well, now, don't rush me,
Mr Conrad.

227
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,881
I'll get it over with.

228
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,925
I don't need any life insurance.

229
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,301
Oh, I think you do.

230
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,553
As a matter of fact, I cancelled
all my policies yesterday.

231
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,723
Oh! Well, now,
is that fair to your partner?

232
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,809
Maybe the business
would require additional capital

233
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,478
if something unexpected
ever happened to you.

234
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,314
Nothing unexpected
is going to happen to me.

235
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,358
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure
about that, Mr Conrad.

236
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,276
Life is so uncertain, you know.

237

and the next you're dead.

Nobody knows what's waiting
around the corner.

Now, take your own case,
for example.

that is, except for your butler.

A short circuit at night,
a fire...

243
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,459
Why, you could be suffocated
to death without ever waking up.

244
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,503
As a matter of fact,
my company just paid

245
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,046
one of these
partnership claims.

246
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,132
One partner
wanted to go hunting.

247
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,676
He took the shotgun
out of the case to look at it.

248
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,095
First thing he knew,
he'd blown his head off.

249
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,431

that nothing unexpected

250
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,807
is going to happen to you?

251
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,851
Well, I'm sure that I don't
need any life insurance.

252
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,186

to get married again.

00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,499
Why don't you try
raising orchids for a hobby?

351
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,543
Let stuff like that alone.

352
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,003
It's liable to awaken
your imagination.

353
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,130
A fellow like you's
better off without it.

354
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,298
Hey, wait a minute.

355
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,925
Thanks for reminding me
of this book.

356
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,677
You've given me an idea.

357
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,388
Yeah.

358
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,767
Maybe I can knock this guy off
without killin' him myself.

359
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,769
What's that?

360
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,440
Do you know that some people
actually die of fright?

361
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,110
See you at the hotel.

362
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,196
(DOOR OPENING)

363
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,240
(DOOR CLOSING)

364
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,587
I've been trying
to get you on the phone.

365
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,130
I've got wonderful news
for you.

366
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,007
Oh, come inside, Alice.

367
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,013
What's the wonderful news?

368
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,639
It's about Clare.

369
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,058
She's alive, Earl.

370
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,455
I can hardly believe it.

371
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,999
Do you think there could
possibly be some mistake?

372
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,626
Oh, of course not.

373
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,421
What she must have been through
these last two years.

374
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,214
Yes, I know, but...

375
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,927
the joy of coming home
will compensate even for that.

376
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,305
Thanks, Alice.

377
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,022
Not only is Clare released, but...

378
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,274
I can go on living again.

379
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,735
Do you realise what that means?

380
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,239
I can look at my friends without
seeing "murderer" in their eyes.

381
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,077
I...

382
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,455
-I...
-What's the matter, Earl?

383
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,415
Oh, nothing. Nothing serious.

384
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,417
I-I've got a...
a call to make.

385
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,252
I'll be back in a little while.

386
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,879
(DOOR OPENING)

387
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,131
(DOOR CLOSING)

388
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,263
Mr Conrad nearly ran me down
in the corridor.

389
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,848
Where's he going?

390
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,850
Well, I don't know,
but he'll be back soon.

391
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,436
I came to congratulate him
on his good news,

392
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,730
but he couldn't even wait
to hear me.

393
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,275
I'm surprised to see you
looking so cheerful.

394
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,779
Why shouldn't I be?

395
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,615
Well, his wife's popping up alive

396
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,826
must have upset your plans.

397
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,494
Now, don't be angry.

398
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,955
Everybody but Conrad knows
you're in love with him.

399
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,790
And I was hoping you'd win.

400
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,959
You might have
straightened him out.

401
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,274
Has, er...
Mr Tomley come in yet?

402
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,109
Yeah, he got in
a few minutes ago.

403
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,486
Oh, I guess it's all right for you
to go right on in, Mr Conrad.

404
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,654
Thank you.

405
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,284
Hello, Tomley.

406
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,537
I've been in and out of here
all day trying to see you.

407
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,914
I want to get in touch
with Lefty Vigran right away.

408
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,917
Tell him I want to see him
as soon as possible, will you?

409
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,628
Of course, you don't know
Lefty Vigran is dead.

410
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,551
No, I didn't.

411
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,719
When'd it happen?

412
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,804
I suppose it's a great
surprise to you,

413
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,223
but he was killed by detectives
as he left that barroom

414
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,100
just after your meeting
with him.

415
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,728
Well, this is a surprise. I...

416
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,065
I haven't been reading
the papers as much as usual, but...

417
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,484
Look, if Vigran's dead,
I'll have to get in touch with

418
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,943
the man that works with him.

419
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,987
I don't know anything
about his friends.

420
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,406
Well, you knew a lot
about Vigran

421
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,824
the first time I came here.

422
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,035
I didn't ask what
you wanted him for then,

423
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,828
and I don't want
to discuss it now.

424
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,498
Well, what's the matter,
Tomley?

425
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,124
You know who I am.

426
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,876
Do you think
I betrayed Vigran?

427
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,669
I wouldn't know.

428
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,713
Well, I'm not an informer.

429
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,591
All I want is to call off
the deal I made.

430
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,384
Whoever's got the money's
welcome to it.

431
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,970
Vigran was a close-lipped man.

432
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,307
Too bad,
but I can't help ya.

(CHATTERING)

436
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,381
I'd like to speak to you
for a moment.

437
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,507
Weren't you in here
the other night

438
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,717
when I was talking to Lefty Vigran?
You know, Lefty...

439
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,594
GUS: He don't understand
a word you're saying, mister.

440
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,263
He's a deaf mute.

441
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,723
Oh, I'm sorry.

442
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,311
Well, maybe you
can help me.

443
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,479
Yeah?

444
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,439
Remember I was in here
the other night?

445
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,651
In that booth over there
with Lefty Vigran.

446
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,445
Oh, yeah, I remember.
What'll you have?

447
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,822
A bourbon.

448
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,993
Do, er... any of
Lefty's friends come in?

449
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,536
They'd better not.

450
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,621
I didn't know the guy you were
with was Vigran

451
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,082
until after he was shot
out in the alley.

452
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,586
You know, I'd give a lot to know
some of Lefty's friends.

453
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,629
Yeah, there were a couple
of fellas in here yesterday,

454
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:54,839
said the same thing.

455
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,465
They were detectives.

456
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,926
Yes, miss?

457
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,052
Sherry.

458
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,847
I'll have another.

459
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,474
Sorry, when you get time.

460
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,607
Er...

461
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,318
Do you remember exactly
what Vigran did after I left?

462
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,069
-Same?
-Yes, please.

463
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,447
He made a phone call,
I think.

464
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Yes, I remember now.

465
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,159
He made a phone call,
and then he sat at the table

466
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,368
at that booth over there.

467
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,620
Then he called
to a friend of his

468
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,913
who was over here
at the counter

469
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,748
and handed him an envelope,
and the guy beat it.

470
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,041
Who was he?

471
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,835
You'll have to ask Lefty
about that, mister.

472
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,295
You're lying.
You know who he is.

473
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,505
-I know you know who he is.
-Take it easy!

474
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,718
I'm sorry.

475
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,261
(SIGHING)

476
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,596
Finding this friend of Vigran's

477
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,723
is a matter of life
and death to me.

478
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,807
Here's my card.

479
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,143
If he comes in again,
will you ask him to wait here

480
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,311
and phone me?

481
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,230
Okay, I'll ask him.

482
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,985
Bartender.

483
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,738
The back kitchen, I think.

484
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,659
Thank you. I want some change.
I'd like to play a record.

485
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,539
He was lying to you.

486
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,793
Let's see what they have
on the machine, shall we?

487
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,300
Did you know any
of Vigran's friends?

488
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,301
Yes.

489
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,594
The man who runs this place

490
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,429
owns a roadhouse
on Mountain View Drive.

491
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,764
I used to sing out there.

492
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,349
Lefty hung around there
all the time.

493
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,393
-What's the name of...?
-I, er, hope you like music

494
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,978
that's sweet and soft.

495
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,688
That's the mood I'm in.

496
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,732
What's the name
of the roadhouse?

497
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,442
The High Hat.

498
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,529
I'll show you where it is,
if you want to go out there.

499
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,072
Shall we start now?

500
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,573
All right.

501
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,624
I should have phoned
for a cab.

502
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,501
I left my car
in a parking lot uptown.

503
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,420
Oh, that's all right.
Mine's right here.

504
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,546
Oh.

00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,303
(DISTANT SHIP'S HORN)

506
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,988
Do I make you nervous
driving around these curves?

507
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,114
No.

508
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,575
I thought you said this place
was just out of town.

509
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,951
It isn't much farther.

510
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,747
Don't you think we should
introduce ourselves?

511
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,749
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Earl Conrad.

512
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,460
My name is Vigran.

513
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,545
Antoinette Vigran.

514
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,714
You can call me Toni.

515
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,888
You mean that you're
Lefty Vigran's wife?

516
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,765
Yes.

517
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,483
Is it possible that you were
Lefty's partner?

518
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,610
-I was his wife.
-I know.

519
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,111
Did you work with him?

520
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,988
-Were you actually...
-Actually what?

521
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,490
I made a deal with Lefty.

522
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,867
I paid him to have
something done.

523
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,286
Oh, yes, I heard a little
about that.

my wife was dead.
