THE WHISTLER:
I am the Whistler,

3
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,152
and I know
many strange tales,

4
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,738
many secrets hidden
in the hearts of men and women

5
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,490
who have stepped
into the shadows.

6
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,244
Tonight, I am keeping
a strange rendezvous.

7
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,372
Here is a strange man,

8
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,166
formed in God's image,
according to the Bible.

9
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,794
But how far is
"image" from "mirage"?

10
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,754
The two words sound alike.

11
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,798
This man looks like all others,

12
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,342
but what separates him
from his fellows?

13
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,761

His name is William Everest,

16
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,293
and he is a man
with a ghastly mission,

17
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,669
which will not let him rest

18
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,921
until it is successfully
accomplished.

19
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,467
But the best-laid plans
which men sometimes make

20
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,510
have a habit of going astray.

21
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,305
Whether in this case
for good or evil,

I seen it.
Just missed him.

26
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,945
Must have conked his head
on this lamppost or something.

Well, I never.

Huh. Put yourself
out for some people,

and you don't even rate
a "thank you".

he gave himself or something.

THE WHISTLER:
He hesitated.

41
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,516
A thought must have
run through his mind.

42

than a second or two,

have been changed

I don't blame you, but...

Why?

120
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,331
Well, I thought
I should tell you...

121
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,832
What did the cards say?

122
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,500
Well, they said...

123
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,044
Well, what did they say?

124
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,421
That you're in very grave danger
for the next twenty-four hours.

Two times, one after the other,
it said the same thing,

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,801
and I shuffled the cards
very well, too.

127
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,013
Does that suggest
something to you,

128
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,973
or warn you of someone, perhaps?

129
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,476
It suggests...

130
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,062
nothing and warns me
of absolutely no-one.

131
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,272
Well, please, just the same,

132
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,067

I'm all right.

139
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,371
It's just that I'm kind of dizzy.

Oh, come on over here
and sit down.

141

won't object, I'm sure.

144
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,428
Oh, I'm all right.

145
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,138
Still a little shaky.

146
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,682

147
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,892
-Would a doctor...
-No, no.

148
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,936
It's just that...

149
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,481
Well, I'm ashamed
to admit it, but...

150
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,234
I don't seem to be able
to remember my name.

151
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,404

152
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,031
I hope you're not injured more
than you're willing to admit.

153
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,909
No, it's...
Outside of a little density,

154
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,911
I feel as well as I ever have.

155
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,913
I stopped in that bar
over there for a drink

156
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,207
and thought it would
sorta clear my head, but...

157
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,792
And it failed?

158
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,419
Afraid so.

159

about yourself at all?

something in your pockets

164

that would tell us
who you are.

165
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,562
Oh, I doubt it, or I'd
have known it by now.

166
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,439
Well, let's look at them.

167
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,899
Come on, please.

168
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,443
Very well.

169
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,572
Gee, I wonder
what's taking Jean so long.

170
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,198
Well, he's a pretty
good-looking guy.

171
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,825
Maybe Jean's gone into details.

172
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,702
You'd better get
the check, Charlie.

very much, does it?

Well, of course.
Don't you see?

190
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,123

sent these roses,

is visit her,

straightened out in no time.

194
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,090
I'd have thought of that myself
if I'd had my wits about me.

195

tell us something about you.

is track them down.

Can I drop you someplace?

00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,110
Well, Civic Theatre?

tried that first.

a lot of trouble.

in this building
or in the neighbourhood?

302

There is no doctor
in this building

303

or within a radius
of four blocks from here.

304
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,214
Are you certain?

305
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,384
I have been in business
here for fifteen years.

306
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,219
The neighbourhood is poor,

307
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,513
and, to the poor,
doctors are a luxury.

308
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,724
Well, I have a prescription here
that was...

309
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,019
issued to a friend of mine by a
Dr Hendricks at this address.

310
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,646
Isn't your friend able to say
exactly where he got it?

311
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,773
Well, his memory was
affected by an accident.

312
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,358
He's right out here.

313

322
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,932
Did he buy one?

323
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,850
No.
Just thumbed through it.

324
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,186

I think he said.

come in here

00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,941
just to browse around.

328
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,109
Do you recall
the title of the book?

329
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,655

and try again
in the morning.

remember where I live.

348
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,365

responsible for you.

Well, that's very kind,
but would it be proper?

00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,252
Quite all right. I share
the apartment with my sister.

have you meet George.

late in getting home, Miss Lang.

She took compassion
on a poor wayfarer

and tried to help him
find himself.

366
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,827
George is the one at the bar
whose fortune I told.

367
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,163
Yes, I know.
Did it take you half the night

368
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,206
to tell him about it?

369
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,209
I should've known you'd worry,
but I was worried, too.

370
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,378
I'm glad you were at least
that considerate of me.

371
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,296
Oh, worried about George,
I mean.

372
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,632
Why, he looks as if he can
take care of himself.

373

Well, that's just it.
He can't.

who I am.

Then who's George?

Well, that's what I call him.

379
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,687
You see, he was in an accident,

380
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,188
and it left him kind of dazed.

00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,273
Hope you like them
that way.

serve me,

522
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,527

standing on edge.

523
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,278
-Coffee?
-Please. Thank you.

524
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,489
Oh, I forgot to feed Barney.

525
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,865
Excuse me.

Francie's very fond of Barney.

527

What's the matter, Francie?

530
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,005
What's wrong, Francie?

531
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,841
FRANCIE: There's something
the matter with Barney.

532
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,509
What do you suppose happened?

533
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,803
I don't know.
He was all right last night,

534
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,179
singing his little head off.

535
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,348

the other day,

asking about this man's
licence number and address.

540
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,532
-I was?
-Sure.

541
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,325
I gave you that
information myself.

542
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,037
You even wrote the licence plate's
number on this Canadian buck.

543
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,415
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
What is the address again?

544
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,667

where I can find

We foreclosed that
property some time ago.

At the time, Judge Nesbitt

553
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,159
was living at
the Forest Apartments.

554
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,452
Thank you.

555
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,289
Is there a Mr Nesbitt
living here?

556
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,874
Yeah, he used to.
He checked out.

557
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,751
No forwarding address.

00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:32,919

call me George?

want me to call you?

594

who you are.

Are you...

619
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,688
Are you a detective?

620
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,023
Why do you ask?

621
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,650
Well, that key
you had on you.

to try to trace down,
remember?

632
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,175

Oh, the prescription
and the bakery order.

-Oh, she was talking to me, Officer.
-Pardon me, sir.

want to say to him?

as though you were

frightened of that policeman.

651
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,134
For a moment, I thought you were
gonna ask him to help us,

652
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,428
because you were
discouraged about me.

653
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,055

654
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,640
Yes, George.

655
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,894
Promise me that you'll see
this thing through with me,

656
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,896
that you won't give me up
for a bad job.

657
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,522
Of course I'll
see it through, George.

658
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,441
And promise me too, that...

659
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,776
anything that you may
find out about me,

660
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,778
it'll be our secret alone.

661
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,031
Certainly. What could
we possibly find out

662
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,741
that would be so necessary
to keep a secret?

663
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,119
Nothing. Nothing at all.
It's just that your...

664
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,872
Well, your kindness
has meant so much to me.

665
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,625
I couldn't get along
without you now.

666
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,293
You don't know
what it means

667
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,337
to wander through
the darkness alone.

668
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,840
We will see this thing
through together, won't we?

669
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,383
Yes, George, together.

670
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,181
Yes. We did this job.
I remember now.

671
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,599
You see, this is
a business district,

672
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,101
and we don't have any
medical printing trade here.

But about a week ago,
a fella came in

674
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,688
and had a few of these
printed up for him.

675
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,398
He paid me above
the market price for it.

676
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,900
Oh, you don't know
his name?

677
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,361
No. He didn't say.
He just waited here for 'em.

678
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:51,612
But, er...

679
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,823
Look, the fella across the street
in that cut-rate drugstore

680
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,325
might be able
to tell you his name,

681
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,410
because this fella went in there
after he left my shop.

682
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,954
-Oh, thank...
-I saw him through that window.

00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,206
-Thank you.
-Glad to be of service.

Yes. Did, er, you fill this?

687
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,095
Where did you get this?

688
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,597
It belongs to a friend of mine.
Did you fill it?

689
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,683
Oh, maybe. Why?

690
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,351
I'd just like to know.

691
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,562
Are you from the
Pure Foods & Drug Office?

692
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,606
Oh, no. I'd just like
this information for myself.

693
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,403
Yeah. Reckon I did.

694
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,738
Oh, do you remember
the man who gave it to you?

695
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,615
-Yeah.
-His name, too?

696
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,993
No. I just remember him
by this prescription.

697
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,953
Why?
Is it so unusual?

698
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,080
Look, why are you asking me
all these questions?

699
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,416
-I run a perfectly respectable...
-Yes, I know you do.

700
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,709
It's just that...

701
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,004
Well, it means a lot to me
to get this information.

702
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,964
Could you tell me
what's in it?

703
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,258
Er...

704
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,176
I'm sure you have
nothing to hide.

705
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,970
No, of course not.

706
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,680
Er... Poison.

707
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,724
What did you say?

708
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,183
I said "poison".

709
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,853
What kind of poison?

710
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,272
(CHUCKLING) Look, lady,
you wouldn't know if I told you.

711
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,774
Poison is poison.
Now, just let it go at that.

712
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,234
And this man bought it?

713
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,611
Yes, he bought it.

714
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,989
Is it a common poison?

715
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,866
Well, not exactly.

716
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,660
It's high-powered stuff.
Kind of scarce.

717
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,037
There's not much call for it.

718
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,289
I-I guess it must be
very expensive.

719
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,540
Yeah, kinda.

720
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,586
You can't sell it without
a doctor's prescription, can you?

721
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,463
What do you call this,
a billet-doux?

722
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,590
Well, isn't it supposed to have
the patient's name on it

723
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,674
as well as the doctor's?

724
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,926
Look, lady, I've told you
everything I know.

725
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,846
Now, this shop isn't
a question-and-answer box.

726
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,183
If you don't care to
buy anything, er... good day.

727
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,414
Hey!
Hey, mister! Stop!

728
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,874
Oh, mister.

729
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,959
Oh, I'd like to
ask you something.

730
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,212
Sure, lady.
Step into my parlour.

731
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,009
-Cosy, ain't it?
-Oh.

732
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,428
Now, look, I-I just wanna
ask you one or two questions.

733
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,388
Shoot, baby.

734
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,933
Look, have you ever
seen this before?

735
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,227
Sure. That's one
of our order forms.

736
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,729
Well, whaddaya know?
A five-pound birthday cake.

737
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,898
-Delivered this one myself.
-FRANCIE: Oh, where to?

738
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,400
Railway Express.

739
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,819
What were they doing?
Celebrating an anniversary?

740
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,320
That's where this guy
ordered it delivered

741
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,822
after he brought it
back to the shop.

742
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,823
I don't get it.

743
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,117
Well, this bird orders
a cake and pays for it.

744
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,702
He hauls it off himself.

745
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,537
Back he comes
the same day and says, er,

746
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,122
"Ship it through
the Railway Express."

747
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,541
Oh, ship it to where?
Please try to remember.

748
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,875
Oh, I ain't forgot, miss.

749
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,420
It seemed sort of a funny place
to be sending a birthday cake.

750
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,213
-Funny?
-Peculiar-like.

751
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,841
I don't know why I thought
it shoulda been, but I did.

752
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,468
A guy gets funny notions sometimes,
you know what I mean,

753
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,553
and I figured right then and there

754
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,513
maybe the one who was getting it
wasn't a regular.

755
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,099
-Well, what do you mean?
-The place it was sent to.

756
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,184
-What place?
-The one upstate.

757
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,019
The, er, Hudson Mental Institution.

758
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,105
Hudson Mental?

759
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,357
Never had to ship a cake
to a place like that before.

760
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,317
Guy's name was, er... Crawford.

761
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,236
Yeah. John Crawford.
That's what it was.

762
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,864
Oh, thank you very much.
You've helped me a lot.

763
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,782
Okay, lady. Hope you found out
what you wanted.

764
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,326
Yes, I did. Say, er...
what's your name?

765
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,661
Joe Blainey.
What's yours?

766
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,372
-Thank you, Mr Blainey.
-You're welcome.

767
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,876
-Bye.
-Bye.

768
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,838
John Crawford...

769
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,799
John Crawford.

770
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,427
"J.C."

771
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,807
"C.C. to J.C."

772
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,351
"C.C. to...

773
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,353
"to John Crawford."

774
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,784
THE WHISTLER: Yes, a table at the
Fountain Café at Rockefeller Center

775
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,744
is a cool and pleasant place,

776
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,454
just as delightful as the park

777
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,332
where William Everest
was taking his ease before

778
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,251
and where he suddenly
recalled who he was,

779
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,544
as he sat on that bench

780
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,255
so kindly feeding
a little squirrel.

781
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,882
But why doesn't
he tell Jean Lang

782
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,550
he knows who he is?

783
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,428
Why doesn't he say,
"My name is not George.

784
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:29,014
"It's William, William Everest"?

785
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,099
Why does he
go on pretending?

786
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,811
It is because he knows
what he has at stake.

787
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,145
Jean.

788
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,022
I remember a name.

789
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,066
Your name? Yours?

790
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,026
The name of a man I know.

791
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,569
Friend?

792
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,531
It's the first actual name
I've been able to remember.

793
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,533
Must have been someone
very close to me.

794
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,284
Does he live in New York?

795
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,078
Woodville.

796
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,955
Well, that's the place you had
marked on the railroad schedule.

797
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,332
-Yes.
-What's the name?

798
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,835
Edward Nesbitt.

799
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,420
That's all you can remember?

800
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,881
All I need to know right now.

801
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,591
We must get there
as soon as possible.

802
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,134
There's a train leaving
at six o'clock,

803
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,971
gets in there at eight-ten.
We'll just have time to make it.

804
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,598
"We"?

805
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,269
Well, of course
you're going with me.

806
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,689
I want you with me
more than anyone else at my...

807
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,232
rebirth.

808
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,694
-Well, I know, but...
-Oh, it'd mean so much to me.

809
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,196
All right, George.

810
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,408
Here, I've just gotten
used to calling you George.

811
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,159
Well, if that doesn't
turn out to be my name,

812
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,911
my real name,
I'll adopt it.

813
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,163
I'll call Francie
and let her know.

814
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,333
-She'll worry.
-Oh, I think you exaggerate her anxieties.

815
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,377
You don't know Francie.
I'll just be a moment.

816
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,879
There's a phone right inside.

817
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,557

(DOORBELL RINGING)

819
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,772
Package for Mr John Crawford.

Mary! Mary!

821
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,859
What is it, Henry?

822
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,695
Another present for Daddy.

823
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,988
Oh. Good.

00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,616

-Hold it, dear.

MAILMAN:
Thank you very much.

826
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,330
-Come on, darling.
-Let's open it!

827
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,248
Now, wait a minute.
Don't get impatient.

828
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,084
Take it in the kitchen.
That's it.

-MARY: Oh! Isn't it lovely?
-HENRY: Oh, boy!

830
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,685
Well, your ma didn't forget it was
your daddy's birthday,

831
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,355
even though she's in the city
visiting your grandparents.

832
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,523
-Gimme a taste.
-Now, it's your daddy's cake.

833
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,609
He's got to cut the first slice.

834
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,527
You just wait
till he gets home.

835
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,988
-Ah, Mary, please.
-Now, now...

836
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,449
Try again, Operator.

00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,036
I'm waiting.

839
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,205
Did you speak to Francie?

840
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,581
She doesn't answer.

841
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,291
Well, you can call her later.

(SHIP'S HORN BLOWING)

843
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,495
Wish I'd been able to tell Francie
where we were going.

844
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,164
Well, we've barely got time to
make the train to Weehawken now.

845
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,582
You can call her from Woodville.

846
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,961
Oh, don't let it disturb you.
She knows you're in good hands.

847
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,296
It's wonderful how you suddenly
remembered that man's name.

848
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,340
I wasn't even making
an effort to think.

849
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,884
Picked up the schedule,
just came to me.

850
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,803
I'm so happy about it.

851
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,222
Woodville. Edward Nesbitt.

852
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,558
I couldn't think of one
without the other.

853
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,729
The one man who can tell me
all I want to know about myself.

854
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,063
It's thrilling.

855
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:08,108
There's no telling who you may
discover you are after you see that man.

856
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,986
-No telling.

-What?

858

Distant thunder.

00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,075

you prophesied's coming true.

at Weehawken.

to make the train.

Hello, Mrs Cassidy?
This is Frances Lang.

Is Charlie there?

00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,922
Five minutes ago?

00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,675
Oh. Well, did he say
where he was going?

867
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,055
Oh. (SIGHING)
Oh, thank you.

868
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,366
(GASPING)
Who is it?

869
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,119
Oh, Charlie, I'm so glad.

870
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,830
Say, I didn't mean
to scare you, honey.

871
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,041
The janitor let me in.
What's wrong?

872
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,667
I don't know.

873
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,629
Let's sit down.
What gives with the weeps?

874
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,422
I've been trying to get you.

875
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,800
It's about Jean. I'm scared.

876
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,051
Jean? What's...

877
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,886
She's been out all day
with that man.

878
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,180
She was supposed to
meet me this afternoon,

879
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,640
and she didn't show up.

880
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,849
What man?

881
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,311
Last night at the Salt Shaker,
that... that man at the bar.

882
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,938
She brought him home.

883
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,731
He spent the night? Here?

884
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,733
Yes. He... He'd had
some kind of an accident

885
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,277
and he couldn't remember
who he was.

886
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,946
Jean felt sorry for him

887
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,781
and she left with him
early this morning

888
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,741
trying to find out
something about him.

889
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,576
What's there
to be scared about?

890
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,411
Charlie, there's...

891
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,705
there's something horrible about him.

892
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,666
Oh, he looked okay to me.

893
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,877
I've been on my own all day
trying to help them, and...

894
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,671
You found out something?

895
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,422
What?

896
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,341
I-I don't exactly know.

897
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,135
I don't get it.

898
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,596
These are some of the things
that he had in his pocket.

899
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,307
Cigarette lighter.

900
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,477
-Doctor's prescription?
-It-It's for poison.

901
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,813
-This prescription?
-A deadly poison.

902
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,022
What's wrong with that?

903
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,732
Maybe he wanted to
get rid of a few roaches,

904
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,734
-or maybe...
-(SOBBING) Oh, Charlie.

905
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,695
Look, honey, maybe you'd better
tell me all about it,

906
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,530
right from the beginning.

907
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,158
-(THUNDERCLAP)
-THE WHISTLER: Yes, they are on the train,

908
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,993
and the destination is Woodville.

909
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,912
But does no twinge of unrest,
faint as it may be,

910
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,873
stir Jean Lang's consciousness,

911
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,666
as she trustingly confides herself

912
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,043
to the care of William Everest?

913
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,462
And that cake was sent
to the same person

914
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,715
whose initials are
on this cigarette lighter.

915
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,924
You're going to the police,
young lady.

916
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,510
-Oh, come with me, Charlie, please.
-No, I can't.

917
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,345
-But, I...
-There wouldn't be time.

918
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,640
Maybe this is something we're just
building up in our imagination, but...

919
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,350
Jean means too much
to the both of us

920
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,810
to take any chances.

921
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,478
But what are you gonna do?

922
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,022
Well, the police may need
some convincing

923
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,815
this isn't just
a little pipe dream.

924
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,025
I'll meet you at headquarters

925
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,776
with all the evidence
I can collect.

926
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,695
-Let's get going.
-All right.

927
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,075
(DOORBELL RINGING)

928
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,539
Man, I haven't got wings.

929
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,041
Why you treat that bell that way?

930
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,126
Is, er... Miss Ivaneska in?

931
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,795
-Yes. Who shall I say is call...
-Never mind names. Is she in?

932
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,589
She's fixin' to go out.

933
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,216
CONSTANTINA:
Flotilda, who is it?

934
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,967
Gentleman here says
"are you in?"

935
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,303
I told him you was
fixin' to go out.

936
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,180
Miss Constantina Ivaneska?

937
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,765
-Yes.
-Come with me.

938
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,683
Wha... What is the
meaning of this?

939
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,062
Mm-mmm. I ain't never seen
nothing like that in Georgia.

940
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,688
Well, what's the meaning of this?

941
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:37,108
-Please let me go.
-I'll explain as we go. I'm sorry, miss.

942
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:48,078
You'll pay dearly for this outrage.

943
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,080
Stop the car and let me go.

944
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:51,748
Who are you?

945
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,541
Well, I was kind of
frettin' about bein' took

946
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,044
from out of a swell dish
of roast chicken, too, but...

947
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,545
but from what this
fella tells me,

948
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,130
why, I ain't complainin' now.

949
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,382
Explain to her, Mr Richards.

950
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,509
Yeah, you see, you and me,
ma'am, are being invited

951
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,969
to stop a murder.

952
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,011
A murder?

953
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,222
Maybe more than one.
Mm-hmm.

954
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:15,313
THE WHISTLER: Leaves at six-ten p.m.,
arrives at eight p.m.

955
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:18,441
That's what the railroad
schedule states in cold print,

956
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,819
but it means far more
than that to William Everest.

957
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,530
It means far more
than that to Jean Lang, too,

958
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,200
but she does not know,
and there lies the tragedy.

959
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,914
I was told Joe Blainey
would be here.

960
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,541
You were told right, bud.
Hey, Joe!

961
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,209
There's a fella out here
to see ya.

962
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,294
Yeah!

963
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,837
-That him?
-That's him.

964
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,755
Hey, wait a minute, bud.
Where you goin'?

965
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,674
-You'll find out.
-Hey, this is a serious offence!

966
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,592
This is kidnapping!

967
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:50,390
That's a very unusual story
you've just told me, Miss Lang.

968
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,975
You will help me?

969
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,560
But the question is,

970
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,021
where does fact end
and fiction begin?

971
00:46:56,314 --> 00:47:00,108
I-I know it's true.
I just feel that Jean's in danger.

972
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,819
We actually don't have
one cold fact to go on.

973
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,696
It's all supposition.

974
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,824
Oh, granted, it sounds feasible,
the way you tell it.

975
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,327
On the other hand,
it could be just mere coincidence.

976
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,787
Well, we've got to take
that chance, Captain.

977
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,290
Miss Lang, I can't set into motion
police machinery

978
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,250
on mere assumption.

979
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,961
I understand your anxiety,

980
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,255
but aren't you exaggerating
the situation?

981
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,965
What if something does happen

982
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,842
and you'd had a chance
to prevent it?

983
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,761
I'd be equally embarrassed
if this whole thing

984
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,346
turned out to be
a wild goose chase

985
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,182
set in motion by
an hysterical young woman.

986
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,858
Here we are, everybody.

987
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,699
But you've got to help me.

988
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,284
That's what the police are for.

989
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,244
If we had just one
clear fact to go on.

990
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:54,788
CHARLIE:
Here are five clear facts.

991
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,499
-Oh, Charlie.
-What does this mean?

992
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,377
-Did you tell him the story, honey?
-He says I'm imagining it.

993
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,254
Miss Ivaneska, tell the captain
the story you told me.

994
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,131
I knew this man
you're all talking about.

995
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,633
Then why did you
deny it last night

996
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,052
when my sister called
on you at the theatre?

997
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,804
I had my reasons.

998
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,514
I met this man a few years ago

999
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,391
at the home of Judge Nesbitt.

1000
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,893
He paid a lot of attention to me
and said he was in love with me.

1001
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,395
You weren't in love with him?

1002
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,147
I liked him. He was charming
and good-looking, but...

1003
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,899
but even then,
he showed signs of...

1004
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,943
-CAPTAIN: Go on, please.
-Well, of that condition

1005
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,404
which eventually put him
in the Hudson Mental Hospital.

1006
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,864
That's the place where I told you
he sent the birthday cake.

1007
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,658
Yeah, that's right.
I shipped it for him.

1008
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,201
Who are you?

1009
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,744
I work for the Elite Bakery.

1010
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,663
That's where
he bought the cake.

1011
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,039
His name is William Everest.

1012
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,291
You mentioned a Judge Nesbitt.

1013
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,752
Is that the same man
who retired a few years ago?

1014
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,588
Yes.
He was in very poor health

1015
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,133
and had lost a lot of money
in bad investments.

1016
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,302
It was he who signed the papers
committing Everest to the asylum.

1017
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,639
Oh. Why didn't you tell
my sister that last night?

1018
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,642
I'm about to marry.

1019
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,019
My fiancé comes from
a very conventional family,

1020
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,938
and he's jealous, too.

1021
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,441
When your sister brought
that man to me last night,

1022
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,276
he didn't recognise me,

1023
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,486
so I pretended I didn't
know him either.

1024
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,780
Although, shortly before,
he'd sent me a bunch of roses

1025
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,657
in an effort to renew
our old friendship.

1026
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,034
And you believe that
this man is up to some mischief?

1027
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,703
That's putting it rather mildly.

1028
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,913
-(THUNDERCLAP)
-He's an escaped maniac.

1029
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,541
He sent that birthday cake

1030
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,793
to somebody named Crawford
at the institution.

1031
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,211
It was filled with poison.

1032
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:26,921
And here's the man
who sold it to him,

1033
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,299
from the prescription
this gentleman printed by order.

1034
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,884
That must be why
he came into my shop

1035
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,594
and asked for

00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,382
Doesn't really matter,
as long as we weren't delayed.

1205
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,133
That label in your pocket...

1206
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,553
Who is John Crawford?

1207
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,389
Just a name.

1208
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,432
Is that his suit
you're wearing?

1209
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,476
I wouldn't know, rightly.

1210
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,354
It's his identification
label in the pocket. It...

1211
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,189
must belong to him.

1212
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,316
Possibly.

1213
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,651
Where did you get it?

1214
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,945
I don't remember, darling.

1215
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,573
You know, there are so many things
that I don't remember.

1216
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,451
I happened to glance at it
this morning.

1217
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,620
How I got it,
where I got it,

1218
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,747
who the man is,
I don't remember.

1219
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,874
You showed
great presence of mind

1220
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,751
in giving that name
to the policeman.

1221
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,878
Found it on
the tip of my tongue.

1222
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,007
It sounded almost rehearsed.

1223
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,969
Oh, you're letting your imagination
run away with you, my dear.

1224
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,262
The policeman acted as though

1225
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,389
he knew the man
whose name you gave.

1226
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,807
(CHUCKLING)

1227
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,226
That's not at all probable.

1228
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,229
When you said your name
was John Crawford,

1229
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,857
he acted as though he knew
who John Crawford was.

1230
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,484
There's nothing strange
in a common name

1231
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:52,820
arousing a familiar memory
in a man, is there?

1232
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,238
You gave the feeling, also,

1233
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,824
that you expected him to know
who John Crawford was.

1234
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,077
Oh, all this is
childish conjecture.

1235
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,039
You think I'm lying to you?

1236
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,167
We mustn't let
any little misunderstanding

1237
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,127
come between us, darling.

1238
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:11,630
We've come to mean too much
to each other for that.

1239
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:13,090
Isn't that so?

1240
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:21,265
Yup. That telegram was filed here
about thirty minutes ago, Sheriff.

1241
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,559
Here's a copy of it.

1242
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,061
Was there a man with her?

1243
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,813
Yeah, mm-hmm.
Nice, easy-speakin' fella.

1244
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:30,483
I lent him my car to go
up to Judge Nesbitt's place.

1245
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,109
Him and that girl.

1246
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,361
Well, it's them,
all right.

1247
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:35,738
How'd you let 'em
get through?

1248
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,616
Said he was Warden Crawford
of the Hudson Mental Hospital.

1249
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,159
Showed identification, too.

1250
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,286
We'd better get down
to the judge's place, fast.

1251
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,954
And you too.

1252
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,601
There's the house.

1253
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:09,271
Our troubles
will all be over soon.

1254
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,940
All over.

1255
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,442
What are you thinking?

1256
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,403
Things will all be changed
in a few minutes.

1257
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:18,656
You'll know
all about yourself, and...

1258
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,866
I'll know all about you.

1259
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,077
Why are we waiting here?

1260
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,704
EVEREST: This moment
is set apart from time.

1261
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,624
I want to prolong it.

1262
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,378
You know all
about yourself now, and...

1263
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,796
you don't know
what you may be

1264
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,464
after you see Mr Nesbitt.

1265
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,759
Is that it, George?

1266
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,140
Hudson Mental Hospit...!

1267
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,392
You're hurting
my throat, George.

1268
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,935
A wonderful throat.

1269
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,271
A wonderful channel
through which

1270
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,022
the inmost secrets
of the soul

1271
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,275
-find freedom to the world.
-George!

1272
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,570
Let it live, and it can
tell the world too much.

1273
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,030
Destroy it, and its secrets
are locked forever

1274
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,824
-from the ears of man.
-George!

1275
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,345
(BRAKES SQUEALING)

1276
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,521
It's Lem Jayson's car,
all right.

1277
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:33,856
They must be around here.

1278
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,191
Spread out, and beat around.

1279
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,651
Now, blow your whistles
if you come upon anything.

1280
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,481
(TWIG SNAPPING)

1281
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,967
(RATTLING)

1282
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:11,138
It won't do any good to hide,
my little sweetheart.

1283
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,183
No good at all.

1284
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,896
And there won't be
any pain, my dear.

1285
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,360
One quick cut,
and it'll be over.

1286
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:29,323
And your throat
will be quiet for evermore.

1287
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,285
Oh, I'm very expert.

1288
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,163
This knife is very sharp.

1289
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,958
I'll be doing you
a great favour.

1290
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,252
Look at it like that.

1291
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,340
Oh, you'll be spared
so much of life's torments.

1292
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:00,062
Come down, my darling.

1293
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,022
Don't prolong your agony.

1294
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:04,233
I'll take you where
it's calm and peaceful.

1295
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,068
Why do you want to kill me?

1296
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,153
I was your one friend.
I gave you shelter.

1297
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:11,031
And I will return your kindness

1298
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:14,785
and give you shelter from
the things which will destroy you.

1299
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:16,995
I will keep you forever young.

1300
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,748
Time and life are your enemies.

1301
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,708
I am your friend.

THE WHISTLER: In a city
full of strange adventures,

1304
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,277
this, which happened
to Jean Lang,

1305
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,112
has been one
of the most amazing.

1306
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,197
Protected by
the resilience of youth,

1307
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,658
Jean Lang will carry
no scars on her soul

1308
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,743
from her encounter
with William Everest.

1309
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,913
And, as time passes,
even the nightmare memory

1310
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,166
will not disturb
her innocent sleep.

1311
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,585
She will marry in time
a man destined for her

1312
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:07,921
and live long and happily
in the fullness of her years.

1313
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:11,592
I know, because
I am the Whistler.
