THE WHISTLER:
I am the Whistler,

3
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,707
and I know many things,
for I walk by night.

4
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,542
I know many strange tales

5
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,085
hidden in the hearts
of men and women

6
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,379
who have stepped
into the shadows.

7
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,548
Yes, I know the nameless terrors

8
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,509
of which they dare not speak.

9
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,469
And one of the greatest
of these terrors

10
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,305
is loneliness.

11
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,973
In my wanderings,
I have seen

12
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,975
the lonely people of the Earth.

13
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,977
I have seen their drawn
and haunted faces

14
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,646
in a city of teeming millions.

15
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,773
And I have seen them,
too, in places

16
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,485
that have been long
deserted and forgotten.

17
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,989
Gull Point Lighthouse was
abandoned many years ago.

18
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,491
But, today, a woman
lives here all alone.

19
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,745
She never leaves her
forlorn and isolated home.

20
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,247
Hers is a strange story

21
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,999
for she loved the bustling cities,

22
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:05,958
the gay crowds,

23
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,085
the laughter of pleasant company.

24
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,130
Why, then, has she shut
herself away in this desolation,

25
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,674
where no-one ever
comes to visit her?

26
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,344
Hers is a story
of loneliness and greed.

27
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,679
It began years ago in a big city,

28
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,182
when the great industrialist
John Sinclair

29
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,684

34
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,832
Mass production was
born out of the war,

35
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,251
bringing with it a new
school of industrialists.

36
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,046
John Sinclair was
the foremost of these.

37
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,645
The Gibson Motor Car Company
was a pioneer in its field,

38
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,815
a conservative company
with limited production,

39
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,317
until John Sinclair
bought the company

40
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,777
and adopted the slogan,

41
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,488
"A Car Within Every Man's Reach."

42
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,787
The year 1929 brought the greatest
financial disaster in history.

43
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,957
Millions were swept away
in the stock market crash.

never failed
to meet its obligations.

48
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,176
Not a single depositor
lost any of his savings.

49
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,054
And John Sinclair paid
four percent interest

50

in his fellow man

00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,322
have driven John Sinclair
to solitude.

00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,784
There has been no time
for love or companionship

94
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,288
in his ruthless drive
for power and riches.

95
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,749
Even over his chess game,
he cannot relax,

96
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,836
for it is through the medium
of these ivory pawns

97
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,632
that he plans the strategy
to expand his enormous holdings.

98

But, without realising it,

99
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,389
he has already strained
body and mind beyond endurance.

100
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,905
I've been telling him
for a long time to take it easy.

101
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,573
Now he's gone the limit.

102
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,242
Another of these attacks
may be fatal.

103
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,369
I want him to go away
for a long rest,

104
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,246
forget about business,
and loaf.

105
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,498
He should go where he can't
be reached by telephone.

106
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,584
A boat trip on the Great Lakes
would be excellent.

107

to clean up the work at the office.

180
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,653
-(GROANING)
-Yes, I know.

181
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,197
I was in the same boat once.

182
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,992
You try and get some sleep.

183
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,953
I'll sit by in case
you want anything.

184
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,167
(CHAIR CREAKING)

185
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,175
So you're John Carter
of New York.

186
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,218
And you're Ernie Sparrow.

187
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,182
Lightweight champion of
England from 1919 to 1925.

188
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,936
Yes, I've had my moment
of glory, as you might say.

189
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,856
-Louis, how's tricks?
-Fine, Ernie, fine.

190
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,775
You know, they still talk about you
in the athletic clubs.

191
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,153
It was a long moment, too.
Morning, Mrs Smith.

192
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,362
MRS SMITH: Good morning,
Mr Sparrow.

193
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,489
I had all the money I wanted.

194
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,116
Boxed before the King and Queen.

195
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,827
I had the whole of England
in the palm of me glove.

196
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,914
-Cootchie-coo. How's the baby?
-She's fine, Ernie.

197
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,292
Yet, er, something
was missing, huh?

198
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,502
Yes, there was. Catch?

199
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,671
You were lonely.

200
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,632
How did you know?

201
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,008
Well, you said that
you were like me,

202
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,343
you didn't trust anyone.

203
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,677
Oh.

204
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,764
I was always training hard.

205
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,807
Never had time to make
many friends then.

206
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,894
Always liked people,
but never got to know them.

207
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,356
It was always
"hello" and "goodbye".

208
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,399
-TONY: Hello, Sparrow!
-How are ya, Tony?

209
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,193
How's the wife and kids?
And how's the business?

210
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,612
-Everything fine.
-Good.

211
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,280
-For you.
-Thanks.

212
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,200
That's for driving
the wife and kids to church.

213
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,535
That was nothing.
I was on me way home.

214
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,037
One for your friend.

215
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:27,955
Thank you.

216
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,790
And one for me, too.

217
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,293
Eat it.
It won't hurt you.

218
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,337
-Bye, Tony.
-Come back soon.

219
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,797
SPARROW:
I will.

220
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,467
I see what you mean
about making friends.

221
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,636
-What was I saying?
-Er...

222
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,595
Oh, yes.

223
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,973
Then, when I got the title,
it was worse than ever.

224
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,432
I had time to make friends then,

225
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,810
but I never knew who
my friends really where.

226
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,395
People always slapped
me on the back.

227
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,646
"How are you, Sparrow?"

228
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,981
"Have a drink, Sparrow."

229
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,358
That was it, guv'nor.
I had too many drinks.

230
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,442
Good morning, Ernie.

231
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,694
Hello, Mike.

232
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,612
I brought home a sack of
charcoal for you last night.

233
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,780
It's down at my place
when you need it.

234
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,740
Thank you.
Much obliged, Ernie.

235
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,492
You were saying something?

236
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,203
I was saying, so you
ran away from it all, huh?

237
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,621
You're right there
again, guv'nor.

238
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,707
-Hi, Al.
-Hiya, Sparrow.

239
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,458
-How's business?
-AL: Fine.

240
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,751
But I'm not sorry.

241
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:15,961
I'm happier in this country.

242
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,546
Here I'm just plain
Ernie Sparrow.

243
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,631
And I have real friends for
the first time in me life.

244
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,757
Here's one of them now.

245
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,009
Violets! Violets!
Buy your violets.

246
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,260
Got you, Ferdinand!

247
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,139
Hi, Sparrow.

248
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,516
Mr Carter, this is
Hammerlock Ferdinand.

249
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,685
He used to be a wrestler
and a very good one.

250
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,645
Now he's doing what
he wants to do,

251
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,022
growing his own flowers.

252
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,064
Hmm.

253
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,816
Glad to know you, Mr Carter.

254
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,234
Remember Ferdinand
the Bull?

255
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,111
He liked to smell
flowers, too.

256
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,487
I'll take that
sprig of violets.

257
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,947
Handle them gently,
now, Sparrow.

258
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,200
Don't crush 'em.
Remember, they're delicate things.

259
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,368
Righto, Ferdinand.

260
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,245
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

261
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,707
So, tell me, Sparrow,

262
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,793
how does a person go
about making friends?

263
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,337
You don't.

264
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,630
People make friends
with you,

265
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,507
if you give them
half a chance.

266
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,093
Well, here we are.

267
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,597
A clinic.

268
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,433
If anybody in the world
can help you, they can.

269
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,852
Last time I was sick,
I was given up for lost,

270
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,104
but, somehow,
they pulled me through.

271
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,065
Well, I'm sorry,
Sparrow, but I...

272
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,649
If you're gonna
trust people, Mr Carter,

273
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,151
you'd better start right now.

274
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,070
We all have to learn to
do that sooner or later.

275
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,279
I did.

276
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,572
Go on in.

277
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,909
Er, wait a minute.

278
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:29,743
Yes?

279
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,328
Do me a favour, will you?

280
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,537
Er, these violets.

281
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,206
There's a pretty
young girl in there.

282
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,375
Her name is Miss Joan Martin.

283
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,293
Give them to her, will you?

284
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,718
CHILDREN:
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo...

285

286
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,348

Oh, choo-choo yourself.

287
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,642

Choo, choo, choo, choo...

288
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,435
Goodbye, choo-choo.

289
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,229
Hello.

290
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,357
They're pretty. Can I smell?

291
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,947
Smells pretty.
For your girl?

292
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,743
No.

293
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,167
Can I be your girl?

294
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,258
My name's Bobbie.

295
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,094
Everyone says
that's a boy's name,

296
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,429
but it isn't.

297
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,306
What's your name?

298
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,225
John.

299
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,106
Well, this is a nice
state of affairs.

300
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,525
The minute I turn my back,
you're untrue to me.

301
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,277
All you women are alike.

302
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,946
I can't help it
if I'm popular.

303
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,909
(LAUGHING) They certainly learn
young nowadays, don't they?

304
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,161
Well, beautiful, if your
gentleman friend doesn't mind,

305
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,704
I must borrow you for a moment.

306
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,747
Goodbye.

307
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,081
Bye.

308
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,129
Hello, Bobbie.

309
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,506
How's our favourite patient?

310
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,757
Just fine, thanks.

311
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,966
Don't be nice to her, Joan.

312
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,760
She's been two-timing me.

313
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,720
-(CHUCKLING)
-No, I haven't.

314
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,347
(ALL LAUGHING)

315
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,934
Will you come in, please?

316
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,188
Just wait in here, please.

317
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,481
Thank you.

318
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,402
Good morning.

319
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,987
Your name, please?

320
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,072
John Carter.

321
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,950
Oh, I was told to take
very good care of you.

322
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,493
You're a very privileged man.

323
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,911
I don't understand.

324
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,663
You happen to have pull
with a certain young lady

325
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,164
by the name of Bobbie.

326
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,666
Oh.

327
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,377
Is your name, by any chance
Miss Joan Martin?

328
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,920
Why, yes.

329
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,923
These are for you.

330
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,467
(GASPING) Well, this is
sort of sudden, isn't it?

331
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,843
What'll Bobbie think?

332
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:34,970
Well, you don't understand.

333
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,930
Sparrow asked me
to give you those.

334
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,974
Oh, isn't that nice!

335
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,809
How thoughtful of Sparrow.

336
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,270
He's always doing things
for other people.

337
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,313
You've no idea how
he makes friends.

338
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,524
You be sure to thank him for me
when you see him, will you?

339
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,733
I certainly will.

340
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,944
Did you wish to see
Dr Rose, Mr Carter?

341
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,487
I hoped I might.

342
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,863
Let's see, um...

343
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,533
"Name, John Carter."

344
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,034

345
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,161
Er, 238 Gordon Street.

347
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:09,921
No wife, no family, no relatives.

348
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,800
And should I add, er...
no friends?

349
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,302
Have you finished
your examination?

350
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,553
There's more
to an examination

351
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,597
than a physical check-up
and a few tests.

352
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:22,267
If I'm going to help you, you must
be perfectly honest with me.

353
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,768
Well, it's no use, really.

354
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,562
I... I've been to too many doctors.

355
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,731
I'm sorry if I've wasted
any of your time.

356
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,983
Well, of course we can't afford
to waste any time here.

357
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,985
There are too many people
who really need us.

358
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,403
And we don't care
who the patient is

359
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,323
or where he comes from, but
we do expect him to help us.

360
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,282
Think it over.

361
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,409
My office is open
to anyone at any time.

362
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,790
All finished?

363
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,417
Oh, yes.

364
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,294
Yes, thanks very much.

365
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,880
Well, goodbye, Miss Martin.

366
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,758
Well, when are
you coming back?

367
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,301
I don't know.

368
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,976
(DOOR CLOSING)

369
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,562
There you are.

370
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,149
You don't often see
a man of his type.

371
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,320
I wonder what his story is.

372
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,287
Hello.

373
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,580
Why, hello, Sparrow.

374
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,123
How's Florence Nightingale?

375
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,250
It was sweet of you
to send those flowers.

376
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,336
By the way,
how's your friend, Mr Carter?

377
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,754
I want to talk about him.

378
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,297
Why hasn't he come
back to the clinic?

379
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,049
I'm sure Dr Rose
could help him.

380
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,175
So am I.

381
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,470
You know, I think he'd come
back if you was to ask him.

382
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,513
Me?

383
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,473
Why, Sparrow,
I've only seen him once.

384
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,266
But you made a rare
impression on him.

385
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,060
He's staying at my place.

386
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,604
Would you ask him
as a favour to me?

387
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,066
-All right.
-Ha!

388
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,117
(ENGINE STARTING)

389
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,371
(KNOCKING)

390
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,081
JOHN:
Come in.

391
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,041
Someone to see you, John.

392
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,589
Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.

393
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,717
Mr Carter, I...
I hope you won't think

394
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,010
it presuming of me,
but I wondered

395
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,971
why you didn't come
back to the clinic.

396
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,391
Well, whatever the reason,
it is nice of you to come.

397
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,728
Er, why-why should you
concern yourself about me?

398
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,396
I-I don't know.

399
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,564
Dr Rose send you?

400
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,982
Oh, no.

401
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,736
I know it may sound
very strange to you, but...

402
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,237
Well, when you
didn't come back,

403
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,406
I began to worry about you.

404
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,367
You worried about me,
a total stranger?

405
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,828
Some people are never
strangers, Mr Carter.

406
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,329
Won't you come back
to the clinic

407
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,873
and see Dr Rose again?

408
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,249
I know he can help you,

409
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,834
i-if you'll only let him.

410
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,210
Will you?

411
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,715
Mm-hmm.

412
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,718
I have the laboratory
reports, Mr Carter.

413
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,636
They are not favourable.

414
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,847
Well, I didn't expect they would be.

415
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,892
Well, of course, I only know
what your body tells me.

416
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,185
But there are things
about a man

417
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,228
that the body has
nothing to do with.

418
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,898
What you're trying to say is,
if there's any help for me,

419
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,859
it hasn't anything to do
with medical science.

420
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,361
Well, something like that.

421
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,238
Well, I was planning
a trip on the Great Lakes.

422
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,365
Well, that's the worst thing
you could possibly do.

423
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,575
Why?

424
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,951
For a man without friends,

425
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,121
there are few places so lonely
as a crowded steamship.

426
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,081
And you'll find the sea coast

427
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,167
much more relaxing
than the Midwest.

428
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,961
Well, go up to the coast
of Maine somewhere.

429
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,671
Get good sea air into your lungs

430
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,799
and wholesome thoughts
into your mind.

431
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,091
Get a job.

432
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,177
And, above everything,
try to make friends.

433
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,304
And never forget, Mr Carter,

434
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,264
that loneliness is a disease

435
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,475
that can destroy a man's mind.

436
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,976
Could a man's mind give way

437
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,020
from lack of companionship?

438
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,149
Could a man actually die
for want of a friend?

439
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,277
You are the answer to
your own questions, Mr Carter.

440
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,198
Well, goodbye, Dr Rose.
Thank you.

441
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,913
Oh, Mr Carter.

442
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,334
Mr Carter!

443
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,515
What's the matter?

444
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,808
Nothing.

445
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,602
I know.
I feel sorry for him, too.

446
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,396
But for your own
peace of mind, Joan,

447
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,897
you can't allow yourself
to become interested

448
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,524
in a patient's troubles.

449
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,986
I guess I'll never get used to
working around here.

450
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,280
FRED:
Busy for a minute, dear?

451
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,489
No.

452
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,491
I want to talk about us.

453
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,536
Of course, Fred.

454
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,621
You know, between
the night work here

455
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,164
and my lectures
with Dr Farnum,

456
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,208
we hardly see each other
except when we're working.

457
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,376
You're right.

458
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,837
I'm really the world's
most neglected fiancée.

459
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:01,880
(CHUCKLING)

460
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,339
But you're the one
who wanted to wait.

461
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,301
You didn't want to get married
until I'd established my own practice.

462
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,594
And you agreed with me.

463
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,304
I've changed my mind.

464
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,389
I think we should
get married right away.

465
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,473
No.

466
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,851
After all, darling, it'll
only be another six months

467
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,353
until you've finished your work
with Dr Farnum. Then...

468
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,563
Then I still won't
have enough money

469
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,939
to start on my own anyway.

470
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,818
Oh, come on, Joan, say you'll settle
for a weekend honeymoon.

471
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,403
I can't, Fred.

472
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,697
I want a home and security.

473
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,324
I want our children
to see the sun

474
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,534
without having to go
to a public park.

475
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,370
And I want you to come home
from your office with pride,

476
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,748
not tortured
and frightened by debt.

477
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,875
You don't show
much faith in me.

478
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,920
Oh, I do have faith
in you, darling.

479
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,380
Everything in me
wants to say yes.

480
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,174
But I won't chain
your life and mine

481
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,051
to an environment like this.

482
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,970
FRED: I wish I could
believe you're right.

483
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,388
I am.

What you gonna do?

487
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,529
I was asking,
what you gonna do?

488
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,157
I'm gonna take Dr Rose's advice.

489
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,660
I know you can get a refund
on your boat ticket,

490
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,579
but will that leave you
with enough to go to Maine?

491
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:20,625
Look here.
This is no time for silly pride.

492
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,419
I've got enough put by
to tide you over for a while.

493
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,380
We'll go to the bank
first thing in the morning,

494
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,173
and you can be on your way.

495
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,094
Well, you hardly know me.

496
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,471
It ain't time that makes
a man trustworthy.

497
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,848
I'm bettin' on you
all the way.

498
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,600
Well, this is the first
time in my life

499
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,311
that anything like this
has ever happened to me.

500
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,604
I don't know what to say.

501
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,273
Just say "yes", and we don't
need to say no more about it.

502
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,443
But I don't need money.
I have more than enough.

503
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,153
I don't understand.

504
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,863
Sparrow, I've found something here

505
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,699
that money can't buy.

506
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,243
Something that I
didn't know existed.

507
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,620
Come to think of it,
a six months' vacation

508
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,580
wouldn't do you any harm.

509
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,374
Why don't you put that
cab of yours in storage

510
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,875
and come along as my guest?

511
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,127
I couldn't think of it.

512
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,129
Well...

513
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,881
If you put it that way,
I can't refuse.

514
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,759
-(CHUCKLING) It's a deal.
-Fine.

515
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,761
-Let's go.
-Right.

00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,059
-Hello, Joan!
-Good evening.

517
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,144
Hello.

518
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,353
Is Fred working again tonight?

519
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,188
I'm afraid I was
rude this afternoon.

520
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,440
Oh, I understood.

521
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,234
I'm putting the old bus
in storage tomorrow.

522
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,986
Mr Carter and me's off to Maine

523
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,446
for health and happiness.

524
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,364
I see you're finished
with your dinner.

525
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,825
Why don't you join us
for a last spin in the park?

526
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,035
Wish you would.

527
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,327
I'd love to.

528
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,912
Okay, let's go.

529
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,835
There were times when we didn't
have enough food in the house

530
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,296
or money for medicine,
when I was a child.

531
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,590
Maybe that's the reason
I went to work for Dr Rose.

532
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,800
Do you intend to devote
your entire life

533
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,218
to working with these people?

534
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,430
No. So long as I work,
I'll remain with them.

535
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,475
But when I get married,
I intend to leave it forever.

536
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,727
Oh, it's not that my
husband has to be rich,

537
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,771
but he can't be poor, either.

538
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,022
I don't want my children to have

539
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,565
a childhood like I did.

540
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,358
Or the youngsters in the clinic.

541
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,444
Well, that's very understandable.

542
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,113
Of course, you do get
away on your vacation.

543
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,574
You don't take vacations
when you work for Dr Rose.

544
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,701
You sure need one, Joan.

545
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,995
Why don't you come along
with me and Mr Carter?

546
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,371
I guess our housekeeping

547
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,873
could stand a feminine touch.

548
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,416
Fred would love that.

549
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,211
Is Fred the young man
who doesn't have to be rich

550
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,088
but doesn't dare to be poor?

551
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,548
Oh, I'm sorry.

552
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,801
He's going to be a great specialist
one of these days.

553
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,177
You mark my words.

554
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,638
He's studying with
the lung specialist, Dr Farnum.

555
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,182
All the evenings he can
get away from the clinic.

556
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,184
How long have you been engaged?

557
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,644
Four years.

558
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,813
Sparrow, it's been a lovely drive,

559
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,689
but I think we
should go home now.

560
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,399
Right you are, Joan.

561
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,872
-Hey, have you packed yet?
-Yes, sir.

562
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,874
-Well, I'd like to pack.
-Yes, sir.

563
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,085
And another thing, let's get started on
a man-to-man basis.

564
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,795
No more of that "sir" stuff, huh?

565
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,630
Righto, guv'nor.

566
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,675
-Say, have you stored your car yet?
-Not yet.

567
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,844
How'd we get to the station
if I put the old bus away?

568
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,512
Well, we could take a cab.

569
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,347
There ain't no profit in that.

570
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,558
(CHUCKLING) Well, you get rid of
that hack of yours.

571
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,892
I'll take care of the tickets.

572
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,811
Yes, sir.
I mean, um...

573
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,104
guv'nor.

574
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,565
(DOOR CLOSING)

575
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,652
Oh, hello, Mr Carter.

576
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,903
Hello, Ferdinand.

577
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,531
-Flowers today, sir?
-Yes.

578
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,367
Well, we have
some roses, asters...

579
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,119
These two I can't pronounce.

580
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,912
-Carnations...
-I'll take all of 'em.

581
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,665
-Violets... All of 'em?
-Yes, all of 'em.

582
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,958
Youse going into business?

583
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,877
No, I want some flowers,
a lot of flowers.

584
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,295
Want to impress a girl.

585
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,088
Oh. Some impress.

586
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,090
Well, these are two-and-a-half.

587
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,050
I'll give 'em for two bucks.

588
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,303
A dollar and a quarter,
for a dollar.

589
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,138
These I'll throw in.

590
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,682
A dollar seventy-five,

591
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,517
eighty cents...

592
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,811
Er, thirty-seven fifty?

593
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,730
-Delivered?
-Delivered.

594
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,525
You take this end.
I'll take your end. Come on.

595
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,447
This is the place.

596
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,491
-What now?
-Wait right here.

597
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:27,914
Why, look, Georgie,

598
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,333
I don't know when I've seen
such nice, fresh flowers.

599
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,459
Yes, very pretty.

600
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,336
Er, how much are
your carnations?

601
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,630
-Two dollars a dozen.
-Why, that's outrageous!

602
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,340
Did you ever hear of
such a thing, Georgie?

603
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,592
What have you got
that's within reason?

604
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,093
Marigolds.
Two bits a bunch.

605
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,095
I don't like marigolds.
They smell up the whole house.

606
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,598
So do roses.
It's all a matter of money.

607
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,391
If you got four dollars
and want to smell up the house,

608
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,601
you buy roses.

609
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,895
If you got two bits,
buy marigolds.

610
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,521
How much are your violets?

611
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,440
Twenty cents a bunch,
three for a half.

612
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,108
Well, that's more like it.
Wrap them up.

613
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,401
They're not for sale.

614
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,487
Didn't you just say they were
three bunches for fifty cents?

615
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,614
That's right, but only
when they're for sale.

616
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,742
Georgie, this man is trying
to make a fool out of me.

617
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,410
That's a wonderful idea.

618
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,828
Yes, it certainly...

619
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:08,955
What did you say?

620
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,248
-Hmm?
-Why, the very idea

621
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,791
of you siding in with him
and insulting me...

622
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,209
(LAUGHING)

623
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,127
Don't you ever say that
to me again. Don't you dare!

624
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,422
It certainly was nice of you
to drop by and say goodbye.

625
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,466
Well, I wanted to bring you
a few flowers before I leave.

626
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,510
How thoughtful.
Hello, Ferdinand.

627
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,719
Hello, Joan.

628
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,680
Look, Mr Carter bought 'em all.

629
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,973
-(LAUGHING)
-All?!

630
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,141
Er, Ferdinand, maybe you better
take 'em in the clinic.

631
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,685
Yeah, maybe I better.

632
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,520
(CHUCKLING)

633
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,689
That was an awfully
nice thing for you to do.

634
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,107
Will you have lunch with me now?

635
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,400
Well, I don't have very long.

636
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,734
Oh, we'll just go down the street.

637
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,069
All right.

638
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,115
(CHATTERING)

639
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,662
You know, there's so much
I have to say to you

640
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,163
and so little time
in which to say it

641
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,540
that I hardly
know where to begin.

642
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,749
Will there be anything else?

643
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,376
No, that's all. Thank you.

644
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,628
What's bothering you?

645
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,839
Sparrow said something
last night, jokingly,

646
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,716
and I've been thinking
about it ever since.

647
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,092
What was that?

648
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,303
About you coming
along with us.

649
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,306
-Oh, you can't be serious.
-I am.

650
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,182
Of course, I realise
that we have

651
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,310
only the most casual
interest in each other.

652
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,063
So I'll put my proposal
on a business basis.

653
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,440
"Proposal"?

654
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:20,318
Yes.
I'm asking you to marry me.

655
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,153
What?

656
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:23,946
But...

657
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,614
I'm not in love with you.

658
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,366
Oh, I know that.

659
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,827
When two people go
into a business deal,

660
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,121
there has to be something
in it for each one.

661
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,415
Now, what you have to offer

662
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,627
is my chance to live a lifetime
within a few months.

663
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,505
In return for those few months,

664
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,091
you'll be able to have
everything you ever wanted.

665
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,596
Does the name Sinclair
mean anything to you?

666
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,514
Sinclair...

667
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,768
John Sinclair?

668
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,604
Yes.
I took the name of Carter

669
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,980
because I'm sick and tired

670
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,066
of the dishonesty
surrounding Sinclair.

671
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,610
I wanted to be another man
for the time being.

672
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,736
Any man.

673
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,404
Oh, I see.

674
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,989
Oh, you don't have
to decide now.

675
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,866
Think it over, carefully.

676
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:14,163
And remember,
my entire fortune

677
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,707

at the last moment.

Easy, dear.

What's all this mystery about
Carter being John Sinclair?

684
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,778
You certainly were
excited over the phone.

685
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,363
Now, suppose you tell me
what it's all about.

686
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,281
I will.
I will in just a minute.

and taking out cards.

689
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,205
Are you sure
this report's correct?

690
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,790
I don't know why
you're so worried about it.

691
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,083
Answer my question.

692
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,584
Yes, I'm positive it's correct.

693
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,255
I made that report myself,
and Dr Rose agreed with it.

694
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,549
Look, darling,
let's find a bench

695
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,342
and talk about ourselves, huh?

696
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,802
Come on.

697
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,806
Oh, it's good.
Good to have a night off.

Well, it can't last forever.

Just a little while longer
and I'll be able

00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,773
to have my own practice.

around the house too much.

704
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,702
Oh, Fred, I do love you.

705
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,704
You must believe me.

706
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,289
Oh, Fred...

707
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,333
it's so wrong living the kind of life
we have to live.

708
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,337
Struggling, never being able
to have the things people should have.

709
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,673
You've been very patient
to stick it out.

710
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,259
But you won't be sorry.
Just wait and see.

711
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,971
Fred...

712
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,724
I'm going to marry
John Sinclair tomorrow.

713
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,602
What did you say?

714
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,812
Oh, I know
it sounds ridiculous,

715
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,773
but it's our chance to get
everything we've ever wished for.

716
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,817
You mean, you've wished for.

717
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,654
It's just an arrangement
for a short time.

718
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,698
He knows he's going to die.

719
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,700
Oh, Fred, try to understand.

720
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,743
It's for us.

721
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,038
It's not wrong.
Tell me it's not wrong.

722
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,789
Tell you what?

723
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,167
You say you're in love with me

724
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,920
and yet you could even think of
doing something like that?

725
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,172
Oh, I do love you.

726
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,799
Oh, that's great. Yeah.
(CHUCKLING)

727
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,468
You're so much in love with me

728
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,720
that you can't wait
to marry somebody else.

729
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,971
Oh, don't lie, Joan.

730
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,473
Why don't you tell the truth?

731
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,517
You never even thought of me.

732
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,560
You're doing it
because you're selfish.

733
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:44,480
Because you're not satisfied
to wait and work hard

734
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,191
like any normal,
decent woman would do.

735
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:51,403
No, I don't think you're
being dishonest...

736
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,113
I think you're rotten!

737
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,241
Why shouldn't I have
my chance?

738
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,910
For four years now,
I've waited for you.

739
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,955
Do you think it's been fun
being alone night after night?

740
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,831
Being in love with
someone you never see?

741
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,416
I'm human!

742
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:08,212
Oh, Fred, I do love you.
I always will.

743
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,714
I've given you the
chance to get ahead,

744
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,341
and you've failed.

745
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,843
Now I'm gonna do it my way.

746
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,763
I've waited for you
because I believed in you.

747
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,848
But you're soft.

748
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,600
You've been afraid.

749
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,978
You're always letting other people
push you down.

750
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,481
Oh, Fred...

751
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,316
Try to understand.

752
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,193
Yeah.

753
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,070
Thanks.

754
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,489
Thanks for everything...

755
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,533
Mrs Sinclair.

756
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,953
Fred. Fred!

757
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,300
THE WHISTLER: John Sinclair
converted this abandoned lighthouse

758
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:55,718
into a beach home.

759
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,386
Here, he learned to relax.

760
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,888
The simple wholesome life
and Joan's care

761
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,099
brought an astonishing
change in him.

762
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,934
But, as the months passed,

763
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,312
the strange bargain
between Sinclair and his wife

764
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,855
took an ironic twist.

765
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,904
You're a real outdoor man now.

766
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,531
You can do a day's work
with the best of them.

767
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,866
Ain't this the life?

768
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,409
Yeah, it's the life.

769
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,536
There's something
bothering me, Sparrow.

770
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,621
I'd like your advice.

771
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,955
Right, Cap'n.

772
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,124
I think I know what
you're going to say.

773
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,125
Yeah?

774
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,168
You're not the first bloke

775
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,128
what's fall in love
with his nurse, right?

776
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,421
Right.

777
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,381
I am in love with Joan.

778
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,467
That's what comes from
getting your health back.

779
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,469
Have you mentioned the
matter to the lady yet?

780
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,262
Well, that's rather difficult.

781
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,139
You see, our marriage
is based entirely on

782
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,474
a business proposition.

783
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,185
What are you going to do?
Eat your heart out in silence?

784
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,062
Well, I don't know.

785
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,315
Trouble is, I've always had my
own way about everything, except...

786
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,442
The most important thing, guv'nor.

787
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,986
I'd have talked to her long ago
if I was in your place.

788
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,196
Have it out with her tonight.

789
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,614
What shall I say?

790
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,034
First of all, I'd apologise to her
for being alive.

791
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,286
You were supposed to die
in six months, remember?

792
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,121
That was part of
your marriage contract,

793
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,706
so, don't you
owe her an apology

794
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,249
for breaking your agreement?

795
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,001
I'd tell her it was her fault

796
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,961
for taking such good care of you.

797
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,547
Maybe you got something there.

798
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,053
Hello, Joan.
How's the water?

799
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,770
Don't you think it's dangerous,
swimming out so far?

800
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,314
I'm perfectly able to
take care of myself, John.

801
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,235
Won't you change your mind
and come with us tomorrow?

802
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,028
You know I don't
like boat trips.

803
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,863
Well, wait just a minute, and
I'll walk up to the house with you.

804
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,365
No, thanks.
It's chilly.

805
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,991
I'm going back now.

806
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,920
Cap'n, maybe my
advice wasn't so good.

807
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,255
Why don't you
wait a little while

808
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,297
before you talk to her?

809
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,341
I'll have to work this out
my own way.

810
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,009
I hopes you know
what you're doing.

811
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,564
Oh, Sparrow, I don't feel
like playing tonight.

812
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,232
That suits me fine.

813
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,568
You must be tired. Why don't you
get a good night's rest?

814
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,570
You know, we've got a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.

815
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,196
I feel fresh as a daisy.

816
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,408
Sparrow...

817
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,203
Oh, yes, come to think of it,
I am a bit tired.

818
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,289
-Good night.
-Good night.

819
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,877
Joan, let's take a little walk
down the beach.

820
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,462
I want to talk to you.

821
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,671
We can talk here.

822
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,006
Oh, but you don't
understand, Joan. I...

823
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,133
I understand only
one thing, John.

824
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,803
I'm leaving you.

825
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,515
Leaving me? Why?

826
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,851
Ever since we've been here,

827
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,937
I've been completely alone,
except for Sparrow and you.

828
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,606
Nobody ever comes near this place.

829
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,233
You even do all your
business by telephone.

830
00:37:58,318 --> 00:37:59,526
I thought you were happy here.

831
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,487
I hate it here!
We never go anywhere.

832
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,571
We never see anybody.

833
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,198
You never invite anyone to visit us.

834
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,699
I can't stand it here any longer!

835
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,494
Joan, we made a bargain and...

836
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,288
That's just it. I've kept my
part of the bargain, you haven't.

837
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:27,554
Oh, it... It isn't being married
to you, John, that I mind. It's...

838
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,598
It's this place!

839
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,476
Are you sure it isn't
your young doctor that you miss?

840
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,479
At first, I thought
that was the reason, but...

841
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,189
Oh, well, that's all over now.

842
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,608
I gave Fred up
when I came here.

843
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,735
Oh...

844
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,987
Oh, John,
let's call off our bargain.

845
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,072
You don't need me anymore.

846
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,198
You're all right now.

847
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,116
Oh, but I do need you.

848
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,452
I've been so busy getting well
that I didn't realise

849
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,871
how lonely you've been until now.

850
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,040
If we were to leave here,

851
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,626
it'd make a difference,
wouldn't it, Joan?

852
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,837
Oh, maybe, I...
I don't know.

853
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,423
Well, we'll leave here.
We'll travel, Joan.

854
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,468
We'll visit all the places
you've ever wanted to go to.

855
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,638
We'll do all the things that
you've ever wanted to do.

856
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,392
I promise you
you'll never be lonely again.

857
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,853
I'll be able to straighten
out my affairs in a few days

858
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,896
and I'll make
all the arrangements.

859
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,524
I love you, Joan.

860
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,318
You've got to stay with me.

861
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,469
Sparrow!
Hey, Sparrow!

862
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,101
Well, I'll be. Doc!
How are you?

863
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,060
What a surprise.

864
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,562
Where'd you come from?
How did you get here?

865
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,688
How long are you gonna stay?

866
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,898
Not so fast, Sparrow.

867
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,316
I'm tired enough as it is.

868
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,067
I've been walking for miles.

869
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,403
How anyone could find
this place is beyond me.

870
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,863
Exclusive, that's what we is.

871
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,031
Exclusive!

872
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,449
Wait till Joan sees you.

873
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,326
Will she be surprised!

874
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,664
You stay here.

875
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,541
Just wait till Joan sees you.

876
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,376
Joan! Oh, Joan!

877
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,503
JOAN: Yes, Sparrow?
What is it?

878
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,630
SPARROW:
Guess who's here?

879
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,424
Hello, Joan.

880
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,593
Fred!

881
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,475
Oh, Fred!

882
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,768
Where'd you come from?
How'd you get here?

883
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,852
How long are you gonna stay?

884
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,062
Oh, you're as bad as Sparrow.

885
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,605
Give me a chance
to catch my breath.

886
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,148
(CHUCKLING)
I'll give you just two minutes,

887
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,275
and then I'm gonna fire
question after question at you.

888
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,402
Oh, Fred,
it's so good to see you.

889
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,237
I'll see you later, Doc.

890
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,658
Come on up.

891
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,959
Clever idea, turning a lighthouse
into a beach home.

892
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,669
An expensive idea.

893
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,426
Is it much further?

894
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,844
What's the matter?
Can't you take it?

895
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,304
This is good exercise.

896
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,764
-Yeah.
-Come on.

897
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,858
Oh, at last.

898
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,152
It's lovely, isn't it?

899
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,780
Yeah. Yes, it is.

900
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,865
Not me, silly, the view.

901
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,451
Oh, sure.
That's all right, too.

902
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,370
This is our solarium.

903
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,621
On a clear day...

904
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:43,208
BOTH: You can see for miles out to sea.
(LAUGHING)

905
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,883
Oh, Fred, it's so wonderful
to see you again.

906
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:52,759
Did you miss me?

907
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:53,802
Of course I did.

908
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,178
You must have been lonely.

909
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,346
A little.

910
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,058
Who's the chess player?

911
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,060
John. He's a master at it.

912
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,979
He's been teaching me to play.

913
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,564
How is he?

914
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,525
Much better than when
you last saw him.

915
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,902
He's gone to the city
for a few days.

916
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,863
Joan, when you
play chess with him,

917
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,990
don't you get a feeling
you're being trapped?

918
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,492
What do you mean?

919
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:21,038
Oh, looking for a way out
and not finding any.

920
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,831
What makes you say that?

921
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,791
I don't know. It...
It's just a feeling I have

922
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,877
that you're not
really happy here.

923
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,547
Joan, you know
it's still not too late.

924
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,717
I tried staying angry
with you, but I couldn't.

925
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,635
Why don't you admit
you made a mistake?

926
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,554
Tell Sinclair you're
coming back with me.

927
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,641
Maybe I'm still selfish, Fred.

928
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,228
But, Joan, I...
I left the clinic.

929
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,606
I have my own practice now.

930
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,358
We can have all the things
we've always wanted.

931
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,653
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

932
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,698
Because of pride, I guess, and...

933
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,743
then I realised I needed you
more than anything else.

934
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,122
That's funny.

935
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,958
If you'd told me this and asked me
just a few days ago,

936
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,502
I would have said yes.

937
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,045
Then why not now?

938
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,174
Because John has fallen
in love with me.

939
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,969
I see.

940
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,430
He made the same mistake I did.

941
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,766
Now we're both in love with you.

942
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,893
FRED: I guess the plans
we made together

943
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,937
don't mean anything
more to you now.

944
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,439
JOAN: Oh, Fred,
of course they do.

945
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,735
Just... Just give me
a little more time.

946
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,737
All right, Joan.

947
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,698
It's gonna be interesting
to see what happens.

948
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,868
But, somehow or other, I'll
make you see things my way.

949
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,121
JOHN: Hello, Joan.
You up there?

950
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,083
Well, hello, Fred!

951
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,253
Well, this is a grand surprise!

952
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,634
What's, er...
What's the matter with you two?

953
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,511
Fred, this is terrific!

954
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,346
It's grand to see you.

955
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,390
Oh, I forgot,
I'm sore at you.

956
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,476
This is the first time you've shown up
since we've been here.

957
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,103
How do you think I look?

958
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,896
Wonderful, John.

959
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,649
You don't look so well, Fred.
Does he, dear?

960
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,192
Well, we'll have to fix that.

961
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,443
You're gonna stay
right here with us

962
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,029
until we close this place
and move back to New York.

963
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,948
Isn't he, darling?

964
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,373
You promised to make up
your mind today.

965
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,875
I have.

966
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,126
Well?

967
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,086
I've been here now
for six months,

968
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,798
shut away from the world,
away from life.

969
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,091
And now I'm going to collect

970
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,051
for every minute of that time.

971
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,513
But we'll still be able
to see a lot of each other.

972
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,057
It'll work out.
Just you wait and see.

973
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,810
How nice.
I'll just stick around

974
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,687
and every time Sinclair
goes out the front,

975
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,772
I'll sneak in
through the back door.

976
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,107
Stop it, Fred.

977
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,151
You must try to understand.

978
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,528
Nothing could ever
possibly come between us.

979
00:44:58,613 --> 00:44:59,571
You know that.

980
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,906
I do, Joan.

981
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,700
We only disagree on
one little thing.

982
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,285
The only way I'll ever come in

983
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,996
is through the front door.
Remember that.

984
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,332
Couldn't you wait just
a little while longer?

985
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,833
No.

986
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,960
You see, I've changed.

987
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,754
You once said I was soft.

988
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,464
I-I let people
push me around.

989
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,300
And you were right.
But not anymore.

990
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,260
I've tried to
get you out of my mind.

991
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,179
I know it's wrong
to keep on loving you,

992
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,181
but I can't help it.

993
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,433
There's nothing
I can do about it.

994
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,769
But you're not
going to ruin my life.

995
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,729
You've had your chance.

996
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,815
Now, I'm going to
do things my way.

997
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,255
I'm afraid we're not
being very good hosts.

998
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,757
Joan has a bad headache
and I'm tired.

999
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,260
Please don't apologise.

1000
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:04,970
After all,
I barged in on you.

1001
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,597
Here's one of Sparrow's mystery books.
How about that?

1002
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,099
Some people find them relaxing.

1003
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,100
Thanks.

1004
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,310
I'll be ready for bed myself,
in an hour or so.

1005
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:13,436
You know,
most people like those,

1006
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,814
but, personally, I can't
get interested in them.

1007
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,941
You always know the murderer's
gonna get caught.

1008
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,401
Oh, of course.

1009
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,486
Murder's one thing
nobody can get away with.

1010
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,446
Oh, I don't know about that.

1011
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:26,116
In real life, there are
some unsolved murders.

1012
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,368
All it takes is the intelligence
to work out a plan

1013
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,287
and then the nerve
to carry it through.

1014
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,871
-You think so?
-Oh, certainly.

1015
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,164
It's like a game of chess.

1016
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,499
Come over here.

1017
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,796
Now, supposing
I had some good reason

1018
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,756
for wanting you
out of the way.

1019
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,925
Here's how I'd go about
murdering you.

1020
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:46,469
(LAUGHING) Don't...
Don't look alarmed.

1021
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,054
Look at the board.
(CHUCKLES)

1022
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,559
Now, move number one,
witnesses.

1023
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,394
I'd establish my alibi.

1024
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,938
-How?
-Simple.

1025
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,440
I'd let it be known
that you'd been

1026
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,108
walking in your sleep.

1027
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,818
I'd tell Sparrow.

1028
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,738
It'd get around the village.

1029
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,531
I'd say that
I caught you halfway

1030
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,992
out of one of these
solarium windows.

1031
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,369
Why not the bedroom window?

1032
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,372
Too narrow.
A man couldn't get through it.

1033
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,499
Then I'd tell Sparrow...

1034
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,879
I'd throw your body
through this window.

1035
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:25,216
At four a.m., the tide
would carry your body out to sea.

1036
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,052
And, as far as the police
were concerned,

1037
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,511
an unfortunate sleepwalker

1038
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,680
had met an accidental death.

1039
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,183
In chess,
that's known as checkmate.

1040
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,770
You missed your calling.

1041
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,313
You'd make a master criminal.

1042
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,565
Well, it's a pretty good murder,
if I do say so myself.

1043
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,484
Pretty good?
It's clever!

1044
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,736
Ah, but there's
something wrong with it.

1045
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,488
There's one thing missing.

1046
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,655
What's that?

1047
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,741
I have no motive whatever

1048
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,284
for murdering you.

1049
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,661
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1050
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,288
You going downstairs?

1051
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,415
Oh, don't forget your book.

1052
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,167
Er, no, no, I, er...

1053
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,378
I think I'll sit up here
for a while and read.

1054
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,840
THE WHISTLER: What did he mean
by that game of chess?

1055
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:09,052
Is he planning to kill you?
Or only trying to frighten you?

1056
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,054
Better leave here
before it's too late.

1057
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,889
You've lost Joan,
haven't you?

1058
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,350
Or is there something
you can do about it?

1059
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,811
(WAVES CRASHING)

1060
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,773
Evening, Fred!

1061
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,358
Oh, hello, Sparrow.
Where are you off to?

1062
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,901
Oh, I'm gonna do
a bit of surf fishing.

1063
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,486
Nice night for it.
Do you want to come along?

1064
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,862
No, thanks.

1065
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,490
Oh, Sparrow, er,
will you do me a favour?

1066
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,991
-Anything you say.
-Thanks.

1067
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,077
Look, when you go down
to the village tomorrow,

1068
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,871
will you, er, stop in
the marine hardware store

1069
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,498
and buy some locks?

1070
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,250
Tomorrow is Sunday, Doc.

1071
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,334
Sunday?

1072
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,086
Oh, yes, I'd forgotten.

1073
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,921
Well, you can get them
first thing on Monday.

1074
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,756
All right. Er...
What kind do you want?

1075
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,007
Let's see, um...

1076
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,592
Just locks for windows.

1077
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,136
How many you need?

1078
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,721
Mmm, there's ten windows.

1079
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,014
I'll need ten locks.

1080
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,641
What you need all those for?

1081
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,685
Nobody can get in through
a lighthouse window.

1082
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,478
It's a steep drop.

1083
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,231
I'm not worried about
anybody getting in.

1084
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,899
I'm worried about
somebody falling out.

1085
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,901
Falling out?
What do you mean?

1086
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,946
I don't want to alarm
you or Joan, Sparrow,

1087
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,615
but last night I caught John
walking in his sleep.

1088
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,117
Walking in his sleep?

1089
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,035
Yeah, I heard someone
moving around,

1090
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,579
so I got up to investigate.

1091
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,414
The noise seemed to come
from the solarium.

1092
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,374
When I reached there,
I saw him climbing out

1093
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,876
through one of the windows.

1094
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,252
I pulled him back just in time,

1095
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,879
or he would have fallen
and killed himself.

1096
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,630
Over-exercise,
that's what it is.

1097
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,674
He's been taking things
too strenuous.

1098
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,468
I'll get the locks
as quickly as possible.

1099
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,720
Oh, Sparrow,
don't mention this to Joan.

1100
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:34,888
She doesn't know
anything about it,

1101
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,097
and there's no need
to worry her.

1102
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,307
Mum's the word.

1103
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,476
And whatever you do,
don't say anything to John either.

1104
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,394
He doesn't realise
what danger he was in.

1105
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,937
He didn't wake up
till it was all over.

1106
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,689
No, I won't tell him.

1107
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,441
Funny I never knew.

1108
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,026
Good night, Doc.

1109
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,819
Good night, Sparrow.

1110
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,868
-Good morning.
-How do you do?

1111
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,954
Will you please fill this
prescription for a sedative?

1112
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,331
It's for Mr Sinclair.

1113
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,790
He's not sleeping well.

1114
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,417
You want it in tablets?

1115
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,127
No, I'd like to have it in
powder form,

1116
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,378
if you have it.

1117
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,547
Mr Sinclair can't swallow pills.

1118
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,344
Here you are.

1119
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,599
Better tell him to be careful
not to take an overdose.

1120
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,975
This is powerful stuff.

1121
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,769
FRED:
I know. I'm a doctor.

1122
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,816
THE WHISTLER: Everything's
working perfectly, isn't it?

1123
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,069
Wasn't it thoughtful
of Sinclair to tell you

1124
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,321
exactly how to murder him?

1125
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:37,408
You know John will sleep soundly
when he drinks this.

1126
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,745
Coffee, John?

1127
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,038
Black, please.

1128
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,624
Thanks.

1129
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,176
Sorry you had
to change your plans

1130
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,636
about leaving tomorrow.

1131
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,596
Er, yes, I-I would have
preferred staying

1132
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,556
until you closed the house

1133
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,974
and gone back
with you and Joan.

1134
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,017
Well, maybe you won't go.

1135
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,520
Maybe you'll feel differently
about it tomorrow.

1136
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,910
Couldn't you possibly stay
a little longer, Fred?

1137
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,413
No, er...
No, my work's piling up.

1138
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,747
I've... I've gotta get back.

1139
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,548
It's been wonderful,
your being with us.

1140
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,092
Yes. Yes, it has.

1141
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,347
Well, I think I'll take my coffee
into the solarium.

1142
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,600
I'd like a farewell
look at the view.

1143
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:44,892
Coming, John?

1144
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,603
I'll be with you in a minute.

1145

(DOOR CLOSING)

1146
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,905
One grand fella, Fred.

1147
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:01,200
You're gonna miss him,
aren't you, darling?

1148
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,786
Coffee cold?

1149
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,165
Well, here, take mine.
Mine's warmer.

1150
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,752
I... I guess I'll
turn in now, dear.

1151
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,503
I-I'm really exhausted.

1152
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,256
I'll have my coffee
before I go to bed.

1153
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,677
-Good night.
-Good night, darling.

00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:50,977
I know you're
in the room.

1159
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:52,729
I know you're in here!

1160
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,439
Where are you?

1161
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,194
I know you're here!

1162
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,614
I know you're in here.

1163
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,616
Please... Please!

1164
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:06,868
I wasn't gonna...

1165
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,579
Sinclair... Sinclair, don't!
Don't!

1166
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,497
(HYPERVENTILATING)

1167
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,182
THE WHISTLER: You told Fred
every step in your scheme

1168
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,142
and he helped you
carry it out.

1169
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,311
Who would suspect
that a murdered man

1170
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,355
would collaborate in his
murderer's alibi?

1171
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,357
Hurry, John, hurry.

1172
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:39,859
The coroner may be
able to determine

1173
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,862
that Fred was dead before
his body struck the rocks.

1174
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,228
No, the windows won't open.

1175
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:18,439
This calls for a quick
change of plans, doesn't it?

1176
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,032
Carry the body
downstairs, quickly,

1177
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,325
and lay it on the rocks.

1178
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,952
Then you'll have time
to come up later

1179
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,954
and open one of the windows.

1180
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,248
It's riskier than your first plan,

1181
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,084
but when you tell the police
about walking in your sleep

1182
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,919
and finding that Fred had fallen out

1183
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,671
while trying to save you,

1184
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,173
maybe they won't examine
the body too closely.

1187
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,421
Sparrow,

1188
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,715
what are you doing here
this time of night?

1189
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,925
I often go walking
in the early morning.

1190
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,510
You know that.

1191
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,971
Something terrible has happened.

1192
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,347
-Fred is...
-The doctor?

1193
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:34,807
Yes.

1194
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,351
I must have been
walking in my sleep.

1195
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,563
I woke up halfway out of
one of the solarium windows.

1196
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,232
Fred must have fallen out
trying to pull me back.

1197
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,693
I saw him hit the rocks.

1198
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,361
It was horrible.

1199
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,822
You say he fell out of

1200
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,574
one of the windows
in the solarium?

1201
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,451
Yes.

1202
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,037
That's impossible.

1203
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,622
Impossible?
What do you mean?

1204
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,291
I couldn't buy locks
on Sunday, John,

1205
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,960
so I nailed all the
solarium windows shut today.

1206
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,424
All right, Sparrow.

1207
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,135
It didn't happen
just the way I said.

1208
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,346
But it was an accident.

1209
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,722
Fred tried to kill me tonight,

1210
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,182
so that Joan would be
free to marry him.

1211
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,726
-I can prove it.
-How?

1212
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,770
I suspected him,
and I rigged up a dummy

1213
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,313
and I put it in the bed.

1214
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,899
I can show you where he
tried to kill me in my sleep.

1215
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,027
Show me, John.
And if it's the truth...

1216
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,946
I'll stand by ya.

1217
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,035
I'll show you.

1218
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,920
There's been a terrible accident.

1219
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,297
Fred fell from a window
in the solarium.

1220
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,633
That's a lie.
He didn't fall.

1221
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,177
I saw you carry his body
down the stairs.

1222
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,345
You murdered him.

1223
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,308
But you don't understand.

1224
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:01,352
Fred tried to kill me.

1225
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,020
No, he didn't.

1226
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,314
You murdered him because
you knew I loved him.

1227
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:06,440
Joan, let me explain.

1228
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,192
It won't do you any good.

1229
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,735
I've called the police.

1230
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,041
It's too late now, John.

1231
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,876
I guess you'll have to face it.

1232
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,265
THE WHISTLER: Sparrow did
what he could for his friend,

1233
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,101
but the jury didn't believe
John Sinclair's story,

1234
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,894
and he paid the extreme penalty

1235
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:46,230
for the murder of Fred Graham.

1236
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,607
Joan inherited the Sinclair millions,

1237
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,526
and went away
to the life of luxury

1238
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,486
she had always craved.

1239
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:54,155
But constantly haunting her

1240
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,282
was the tragedy that cost the lives

1241
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,368
of the man she loved
and the man she married.

1242
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:02,538
She travelled from city to city,
seeking forgetfulness.

1243
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,499
But there was no
escape from the past.

1244
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,376
She came back, at last,

1245
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,754
to live out a life of torment

1246
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,174
in the solitude and
desolation of the lighthouse.

1247
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:17,803
I know, because
I am the Whistler.

1248
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,808
(WHISTLING HIS THEME)
