I am the Whistler,

00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,649
and I know many things,

00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,526
for I walk by night.

5
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,778
I know many strange tales

6
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,905
hidden in the hearts
of men and women

7
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,991
who have stepped
into the shadows.

8

in this obscure section
of a large city,

12
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:29,255
we find a woman shopping
for an unusual item.

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,639
Find anything you like?

14
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,559
Yes. I'll show you.

15
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,813
I want this one.

16

In marble.

17
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,110
Yes, ma'am, but
executed in marble,

18
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,070
it will be quite expensive
and, er...

19
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,989
around five thousand dollars,

20
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,742
and will require about
three months' work.

21
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,536
Three months?
That'll be all right.

00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,046
I'll drop over soon as
Jim is fed up with me.

00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,172
That's what I wanted to hear.

157
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,133
Well, goodbye, Jim.

158
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,473

to pose for him?

Well, I have to earn
a living, don't I?

160
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,059
Yeah, but you don't
have to pose

Well, maybe so,
but you be careful.

If he gets fresh, why,
threaten to tell his wife.

176
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,632
That'll stop him quick.

If he loses that meal ticket,

178
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,220
he'll have to go back making
sketches at the fairground.

179
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,974
Well, you finally managed
to get here, I see.

180
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,727
Don't pick on me, Mac.
I had a rough night.

181
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,437
I thought you were old
enough to know better.

182
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,772
I am, but Linda
dragged me along

183
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,900
to one of those artist shindigs.

184
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,111
I got a tip on a story here
that's right down your alley.

185
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,237
Yeah? Give.

186
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,864
Recall that unidentified stiff

187
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,200
the coast guard pulled out
of the bay, several months ago?

188
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,659
Yeah, but spare the details.

189
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,411
My stomach is doing
nip-ups already.

190
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,580
Well, Mr X's grave in Potter's Field

191
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,708
now bears a magnificent monument
instead of a numbered marker.

192
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,293
What does it say
on the inscription?

193
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,837
That's the point.
There is no inscription.

194
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,505
Well, that means
somebody identified him

195
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,799
-but didn't want it known.
-Right.

196
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,760
Think I need a little fresh air.

197
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,887
I don't know the name of the
firm that set up the monument.

198
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,263
You ask Parker.
He discovered it.

199
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,640
Thanks, Mac.

200
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,602
Yes, I'll take care of it
right away.

201
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,520
Thank you. Goodbye.

202
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,733
Good morning, sir.

203
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,985
Are you interested
in selecting a memorial?

204
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,946
No, but I am interested
in finding out

205
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,489
who purchased
the beautiful edifice

206
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,950
for that nameless grave
in Potter's Field.

207
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,118
I'm Conroy
of the News-Tribune.

208
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,497
Oh, well, I'm afraid
I can't give you the answer.

209
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,499
You see, we don't know
the name of the purchaser.

210
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,458
How come?

211
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,626
Well, it happened like this.

212
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,878
The order came in the mail
signed "A Friend".

213
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,256
Enclosed with it were twenty-five
one-hundred-dollar bills,

214
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,966
so we filled the order.

215
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,092
It's none of our business

216
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,177
if the friend wishes
to remain anonymous.

217
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,887
Well, certainly not,

218
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,181
but buying a monument
without giving an inscription

219
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,724
sounds screwy to me.

220
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,269
Those sort of things are
common in our business.

221
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,104
Why, only last night,
a woman came in here

222
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,313
shopping for a tombstone.

223
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,482
She'd picked out one of those
"big gates ajar" numbers,

224
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,067
and when I asked her
for the inscription,

225
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,652
she said,
"Edith Marie Harrison,

226
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,029
"beloved wife
of Ralph Harrison."

227
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,864
Ralph Harrison?

228
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,491
Yes.
Do you know him?

229
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,326
I know an artist
by that name.

230
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,037
Well, anyhow, when I
asked her for her name,

231
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,665
she said, "Edith Marie Harrison,"
just like that.

232
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,583
Never batted an eye.

233
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,961
You mean she bought
the monument for herself?

234
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,254
Why, yes.

235
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,506
Isn't that one for the book?

236
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,009
Yeah.

237
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,096
Mm-hmm.

238
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,890
You may have ten minutes
with your husband now.

239
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:29,641
Oh, how nice.

240
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,601
If you promise to
control your emotions.

241
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,811
I will.

242
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,106
Miss Bailey, would you
please bring me a lipstick

243
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,941
and my diary
from the desk drawer.

244
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,485
Now, now, now. You will have
plenty of time for your diary

245
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,904
-when I permit you to sit up.
-All right.

246
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,991
Let's see how much you can
improve by my next visit, huh?

247
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:46,950
I will.

248
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,411
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Dr Winthrop.

249
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,665
We'll continue
the same medication

250
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,251
-for the next twenty-four hours.
-Yes, Doctor.

251
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,677
You may see her now,
but make it brief.

252
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,513
And wipe that worried look
from your face before you go in.

253
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,811
(KNOCKING)

254
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,531
-Well, darling.
-Dearest.

255
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,578
Oh, I'm so glad you're better.

256
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,664
You know, I didn't sleep
last night, worrying about you.

257
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,249
You're such a dear.

258
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,628
And all the lovely flowers.
Thank you very much.

259
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,254
What did the doctor say?

260
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,799
Oh, he's convinced that
you'll recover completely.

261
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,677
But you're going to have to stay
in bed, perhaps for weeks.

262
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,014
I was afraid he'd say that.

263
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,808
What difference does that make?

264
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,602
We'll make it up
by taking a trip somewhere.

265
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,730
We'll make believe
we're on our honeymoon again.

266
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,732
That'll be wonderful, Ralph.

267
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,924
You better rest a while, Kay.

268
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,676
I'll get you a cold drink.

269
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,985
-There you are.
-Thank you.

270
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,446
You're a most
considerate employer.

271
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,738
Thank you.

272
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,744
Penny for your thoughts.

273
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,705
Oh, they're not worth a penny.

274
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,458
As a matter of fact, I'm not
in the mood for sketching.

275
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,209
What do you generally do
to get in the mood?

276
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,712
Oh, go to Montmartre,
have lunch,

277
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,755
listen to the gypsy music.

278
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,841
Why don't you try it again?

279
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,178
I can find something around here
to do in the meantime.

280
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,762
I want you to go with me.

281
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,347
Oh?

282
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,099
Maybe your wife
wouldn't like it.

283
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,934
Oh, she's not
that conventional.

284
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,103
Well, I am a bit hungry.

285
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,563
Good. Let's go.

286
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,670
(BAND PLAYING LIGHT MUSIC)

287
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,227
What's troubling you, Ralph?

288
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,979
You seem to be brooding
over something.

289
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,356
Oh...

290
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,317
I don't want to bore you
with my troubles.

291
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,819
It might make you feel better
if you got it off your chest.

292
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,280
Well, when I left my party
the other night,

293
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,823
I was called home.

294
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,826
My wife had suffered
her second heart attack.

295
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,787
Oh, how awful!

296
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,331
I came back to the party later

297
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,833
'cause there wasn't anything
I could do.

298
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,921
In fact, I'm afraid there isn't
anything anyone can do.

299
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,840
No wonder you couldn't work.

300
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,552
It must have taken a lot
of courage even to attempt it.

301
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,971
You don't know
the strain it's been,

302
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,014
living day to day,
not knowing what moment

303
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,725
I'll get word that she's
had another attack or...

304
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,018
passed on.

305
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,313
Poor soul.
Think of the strain on her, too,

306
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,191
knowing she's only living
on borrowed time.

307
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,610
Yes, it's getting me down.

308
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,862
Isn't there any chance
for her to get well?

309
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,114
Doctor says not.

310
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,075
That's why
I need companionship,

311
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,201
trying to forget.

312
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,870
I'm so glad you told me,
Ralph.

313
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,374
I only wish there was something
I could do to help you.

314
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,003
There is.
If you'd just be my friend,

315
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,130
dine with me occasionally,

316
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,007
let me confide in you.

317
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,633
It would help a lot.

318
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,719
Left hand for friendship.

319
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,141
Hiya, kitten!

320
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,392
Hi!

321
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,603
Come on, peel off
that Eskimo parka.

322
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,771
I'm taking you to a place
where they make crêpes Suzettes

323
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:27,772
that are out of this world.

324
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,566
What? At this hour?
It's after twelve.

325
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,901
So what? Suzettes always taste
better along toward morning,

326
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,528
seeing as how they're pancakes.
Come on, come on.

327
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,946
(CHUCKLING)
All right, I'll go,

328
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,574
but you're bringing me
right back after the Suzettes.

329
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,994
No gallivanting around
till dawn. Understand?

330
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,912
-Cross my heart.
-(CHUCKLING)

331
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,414
Say, Linda,
this is a nice job,

332
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,124
this magazine cover
you're doing.

333
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,792
Thank you, Joseph Aloysius.

334
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,711
Your model must have
been a raving beauty.

335
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,795
Did I ever meet her?

336
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,088
You did not.

337
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,341
You're not gonna get
a chance to, either.

338
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,258
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

339
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,636
That's how I lost
my last boyfriend.

340
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,691
Say, wasn't that the model you
said Calhoun was crazy about?

341
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,402
Yes! Kay Morrell.

342
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,155
Maybe Harrison ought to be
painting barns instead of pictures,

343
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,532
but he isn't so dumb
at picking a nifty dish.

344
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,660
Well, I'm not so sure
he did the picking.

345
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,702
Oh?

346
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,954
Kay had a little larceny
in her make-up.

347
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,374
I know, because
she posed for me.

348
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,959
I wonder if she knows
what I know.

349
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,378
Knows what?

350
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,172
Remind me sometime
to tell you the story

351
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,715
the story of

You darling!

Like it?

365
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,380
Oh, I'm crazy about it.

366

It's the most beautiful gift
I've ever received,

367
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,927
but I can't accept it
from you.

368
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,971
Why not?

369
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,306
You know why.

370
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,851
I appreciate your
thoughtfulness, Ralph, but...

371
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,354
I'm sure you'll think much
more of me for not accepting it.

372

I have no right to say this,

373

but I've grown to care
a great deal for you.

374
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,947
If I were free,
I would ask you to marry me.

375

How would you feel
about that?

376
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,999
I had no idea
you cared that much for me.

377

But you're not free, Ralph,

378
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,753
so let's not even
think about it.

379
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,254
We'll just be friends.

380
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,760
If we don't hurry, we'll be
late for the theatre.

Well, don't be discouraged.

385

Your weakness is due
mainly to, er... inactivity.

I'm sure I can.
Goodbye.

I'd like to see
a cardiograph of her.

392

-I presume you have one?
-Several.

393

we get back to the office.

Mr Harrison, this is Dr Gunther.

398

-How do you do, Mr Harrison?
-How do you do?

399
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,736
Dr Gunther is a specialist.

400
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,322
-I brought him in for a consultation.
-Good idea.

401
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,950
I believe he'd be able to do
Mrs Harrison some good.

402
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,535
He's been achieving
remarkable results

403
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,870
with heart cases
such as hers.

404
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,705
Well, I'd give anything
if you could help my wife.

405
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,541
Mmm, I'll do all I can.
You may be sure of that.

aren't you, Ralph?

If Dr Gunther can
make Edith well again,

411
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,868
it'll spoil all your plans.

412

You know you're only waiting
and hoping for her to die

413
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,790
so you'll be free
to marry Kay.

see you on a horse.

-Thanks.

for introducing you
to Harrison?

437

It's the general idea.

438

Doing all right
for yourself, huh?

439
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,271
Well, what started out
as a routine job

440
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:45,024
has possibilities now of
turning into a career.

Maybe so.

Come in.

526
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,641
Darling!

527
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,937
Why, you're actually
up and dressed?

528
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,482
Well, when did this happen?

529
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,192
This morning.

530
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,902
Well, what a pleasant surprise.

531
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,528
Why didn't you tell me?

532
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,864
Well, you don't know
how glad I am.

533
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,742
What's the matter,
darling?

534
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,869
Stop acting, Ralph.

535
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,331
There's nothing quite so
contemptible as a hypocrite.

536
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,707
A hypocrite?

537
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,959
How... How am I going to
defend myself

538
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,836
if I don't know
what you're talking about?

539
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,340
You have no defence
for what you've done to me.

540
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,133
But what have I done?

541
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,970
You destroyed all the love
and respect I ever had for you.

542
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,474
It was such a nice day.

543
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,434
I took a ride this afternoon.

544
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,062
I was so happy
to be out again.

545
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,648
I'd been thinking for days
how glad you'd be

546
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,525
that I was getting well.

547
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,486
I stopped at your studio...

548
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,364
but you were out.

549
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,575
So I had the porter
let me in.

550
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,703
I wanted to surprise you.

551
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,081
But the surprise was on me.

552
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,625
I was there
in the dressing room

553
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,210
when you came in
with her.

554
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,425
Well...

555
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,011
I'm glad you found out
about it, in a way.

556
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,223
I've been wanting to tell you,
but I didn't know how.

557
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,810
I guess it was the worry
about you night and day, and...

558
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,229
the loneliness without you.

559
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,566
I wanted companionship,
and she led me on.

560
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,276
Oh, stop lying, Ralph!
It's perfectly obvious

561
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,319
that I'm standing
in the way of your romance.

562
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,779
That you're even hoping
that I'll die

563
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,824
-so that you'll be free to have her.
-That's not true.

564
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,252
I don't think
you ever loved me.

565
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,464
I've just been a convenience
with a chequebook.

566
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,507
I still love you.
I swear I do.

567
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,303
I despise you
for what you are.

another penny of my money.

00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,319
I'll make it up to you
if you'll give me a chance.

You may use the studio
temporarily, until you find another.

573

you'd rather go back

and his wife have gone out,

them back until late.

583
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,077
Yes. Will you ask him
to call me when he comes in?

Please tell him it's urgent.

had a slight misunderstanding.

did the doctor believe
she died from natural causes?

done all he could for her.

to experiment.

She resents me, Ralph.

699
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,529
Oh, don't pay any
attention to her. (CHUCKLING)

700
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,198
She's a part
of the past, isn't she?

701
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,075
Yes. She worked
for Edith for years.

702
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,618
Why don't you
get rid of her?

703
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,536
Well, I'd like to,
but Edith had it in her will

704
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,747
that she was to have
employment and a home here

705
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,207
as long as she lives.

706
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,292
Oh, don't think about it.
I'll take care of it later.

707
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,336
I want to show you
the house.

708
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,017
Well, what do you think?

709
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,143
Lovely.

710
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,812
It couldn't be more perfect.

711
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,522
I'm so glad you like it.

712
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,107
(KNOCKING)

713
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,733
Come in.

714
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,027
Yes, Laura.

715
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,696
Here's the mail that came
while you were away.

716
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,197
Oh, thanks.

717
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,949
Excuse me, darling.

718
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,401
Anything wrong, dear?

719
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,863
Oh, no, no. It's a bill for
something Edith ordered

720
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,073
that I didn't know
anything about.

721
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,201
Let's go down to
dinner, huh?

722
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,369
All right.

723
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,461
(LIGHT MUSIC PLAYING)

724
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,392
Good day, sir.
Come in, please.

725
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,560
I hope I'm not too late.

726
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,062
Not at all, sir.

727
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,194
-Kay.
-KAY: Hello, Joe.

728
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,904
-Ralph.
-I'm glad you could come.

729
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,239
I'm sorry I'm late, but you know
how it is, working for a newspaper.

730
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:51,493
You're only one drink behind,
and we'll fix that right up.

731
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,660
Hiya, Linda.

732
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,413
LINDA: Well, what kept you
so late, Mr Conroy? A woman?

733
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:56,790
Well, it was
a woman at that.

734
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,875
Or perhaps I should say
Exhibit A

735
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,502
in a slight case of murder.

736
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,753
Who got the axe this time?

737
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,004
Mrs Blanche Bennett.

738
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:06,800
Only it happened to be a .45-calibre slug
that did the business, not an axe.

739
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,052
Mmm.
I thought a burglar shot her.

740
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,012
That's what
the police thought, too,

741
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,223
until a smart cop from
Homicide named Higgins

742
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,475
discovered that Bennett had been
running around for some time

743
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,060
with another woman.

744
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,270
Well, is that sufficient proof
that Bennett killed her?

745
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,106
No, but it's
a darn good motive.

746
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,982
Bennett?
What Bennett is that?

747
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,818
James Bennett,
the hotel man.

748
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,486
Oh.

749
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,905
The story broke while you and
Kay were on your honeymoon.

750
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,117
Anyway, Bennett
was arrested this morning,

751
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,494
and I happen to know the D.A.'s
preparing an indictment

752
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,621
charging him
with premeditated murder.

753
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,289
(GLASS THUDDING)

754
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,833
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

755
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,251
I hope I haven't
ruined your dress.

756
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,627
LINDA:
Oh, think nothing of it.

757
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,671
I shall just sue you for
damages, Ralph Harrison.

758
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,965
Go ahead.
Everybody sues the rich.

759
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,009
By the way, Ralph.

760
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,804
What did you ever do
with that gravestone?

761
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,888
Gravestone?

762
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:57,016
Yeah. The one from
the Curtis Monument Company.

763
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,810
Oh, that.

764
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,021
Why, I paid for it,
and told 'em to keep it.

765
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,274
Joe, I'd like you
to meet some people.

766
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,608
Excuse me.

767
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,435
What are you doing
out here, Ralph?

768
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,770
Oh, just having a smoke.
I couldn't sleep.

769
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,397
Anything troubling you?

770
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,940
No, not a thing.

771
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,109
Ralph...

772
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,194
Yes?

773
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,445
What did Joe Conroy mean

774
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,739
when he asked you
about that gravestone?

775
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,449
He was referring
to a monument

776
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,993
that Edith
had ordered for herself.

777
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,287
Then you didn't know
she'd expected to be buried.

778
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,580
We didn't discuss such things.

779
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,831
I didn't know anything
about the monument

780
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,458
till I got a bill for it.

781
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,837
Too bad she never told you
about it, don't you think?

782
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,964
Kay, please.
Let's not discuss it.

783
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,175
I'm sorry.

784
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,938
Didn't you get any
sleep last night, dear?

785
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,648
RALPH: Guess I ate
too much at the party.

786
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,066
Never again.

787
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,949
"Bennett confesses
to murder.

788
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,411
"Breaks down after
hours of questioning.

789
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,706
"After sticking steadfastly
to his plea of innocence,

790
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,208
"Bennett suddenly
broke down

791
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,918
"and confessed to
the murder of his wife

"when confronted with
the damaging evidence

793

"contained in her diary.

794

"They also spoke
of her growing fear

"that he was planning
to kill her."

800
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,436
Oh! How awful it must
be for a wife to suspect

801
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:07,438
that her husband
is planning to kill her.

802
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,190
Mm-hmm.

803
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:24,872
Why do you hate me,
Laura?

804
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,416
I've never done you
any harm.

805
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,877
Ralph Harrison's
love for you

806
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,171
is what caused
Edith's death.

807
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,090
But why blame me?

808
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,883
I certainly did nothing
to encourage Ralph

809
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,510
while she was still alive.

810
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,846
You didn't waste any time
after she was gone.

811
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,014
Well, why should I?

812
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,390
I was tired
of fighting for a living

813
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,309
and marriage to him
meant security.

814
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,769
You have no right
to ease and luxury

815
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,479
provided by her money.

816
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:49,731
I have the right
of every wife

817
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,316
to share her husband's
worldly goods.

818
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,775
He only married her
for her money,

819
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,193
and then he waited
for her to die,

820
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,696
so he could get himself a younger
and more attractive woman.

821
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,822
Stop it, Laura!

822
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,991
I won't allow you to say
such things about my husband.

823
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,285
-They're not true.
-You don't have to believe me.

824
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,494
Ask Mr Loring.

825
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,997
He'll tell you that she phoned him
the night she died.

826
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,832
What are you driving at?

827
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,876
She was going to
change her will.

828
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,127
If Loring had been in
that night,

829
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,837
your husband would be
a pauper today.

830
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,299
Why are you
telling me all this?

831
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,426
Everyone thinks she died
of another heart attack.

832
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,844
Well, I'm not so sure.

833
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,429
I won't listen to
another word.

834
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,222
Ralph isn't
that kind of a man.

835
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,141
Besides,
if you had any proof,

836
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,435
you'd tell the district attorney,
not me.

837
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,937
Believe what you like.
You have to live with him.

838
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,564
But the police
were certain, too,

839
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,107
that a burglar
killed Mrs Bennett.

840
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,026
And her husband would
have gotten away with murder

841
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,278
if they hadn't found
her diary.

842
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,573
Edith Harrison
kept a diary, too.

843
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,297
LAURA:
What are you looking for?

844
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,758
KAY:
I don't really know, but...

845
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,843
what you told me
a while ago made me think.

846
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,929
So, you're beginning
to suspect, as I do,

847
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,096
that he killed Edith.

848
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,431
Don't say that.

849
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,516
If I thought he did,

850
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,601
I'd be afraid to stay
with him another day.

851
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,144
Do you think
I've liked staying here,

852
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,354
believing him a murderer?

853
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,398
I only did it in the hope of
finding some way to make him pay

854
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,192
for all the suffering
he caused her.

855
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,110
That sounds too awful
to believe.

856
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,988
Can't you see that he acts like
a man with a guilty conscience?

857
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,949
Well, he has been
acting rather strangely,

858
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,909
now that you mentioned it.

859
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,913
Laura, whatever became
of Mrs Harrison's medicines?

860
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,623
I threw them out.

861
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,875
-All of them?
-Why, of c...

862
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,044
No, come to think of it,

863
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,004
there was one bottle
I couldn't find,

864
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:45,258
one of those special prescriptions
that you can't have refilled.

865
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,759
I wonder what
happened to it?

866
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,220
Mrs Harrison was supposed
to take another dose at nine o'clock

867
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,180
the night she passed away,

868
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,850
nearly an hour after
Mr Harrison left the house.

869
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,561
No wonder he blamed
Dr Gunther for her death.

870
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:57,854
What do you mean?

871
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,064
He claimed he wanted to have
all of her medicines analysed.

872
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,691
until I told him
I'd thrown them out.

873
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,192
Don't you see?

874
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,486
He was looking for that bottle.

875
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:07,405
Then Edith must have
hidden it somewhere.

876
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,324
Yes! Yes, it must be here
amongst all the things

877
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,285
they brought up
from her bedroom.

878
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,965
Well, come in.

879
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,592
What's the matter, Kay?

880
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,677
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

881
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:30,803
Has Ralph been here today?

882
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,388
No. I haven't seen him
for quite a while.

883
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,557
Please lock the door. I don't
want him to know I'm here.

884
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,808
Now, look. I don't wanna
get mixed up

885
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,977
in any of your domestic troubles.
I've got enough to worry about.

886
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,645
It's nothing like that,
believe me.

887
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,064
I need advice, and you're the
only friend I can turn to.

888
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,567
Okay, but remember,
I'm not pulling any chestnuts

889
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,651
out of the fire for you.

890
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:46,944
You won't have to.

891
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,279
Jim, I'm frightened.

892
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,906
I think I'm married
to a murderer.

893
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,116
-What?!
-I think Ralph poisoned Edith.

894
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,075
Are you crazy?

895
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,869
You know she died
of a heart attack.

896
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,913
I'm not so sure about that.

897
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,081
He could easily put
something in her medicine.

898
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,625
Well, now,
why would he do that?

899
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,251
She was dying anyway,
wasn't she?

900
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,420
No. She was getting well.

901
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,296
Oh.

902
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,381
Well, you haven't
any proof against him.

903
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:08,716
Maybe I have.

904
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,761
I found this hidden away in
Edith's knitting bag in the attic,

905
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,346
and I think
there's poison in it.

906
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,806
"Take one teaspoonful
every three hours."

907
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,308
When was it she died?

908
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,060
The twenty-sixth of last May.

909
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,354
And this prescription's
dated May sixteenth.

910
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,689
Hmm. Maybe you've
got something, Kay.

911
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,900
How do I go about
having it analysed?

912
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,402
I didn't know you were
that cold-blooded.

913
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:29,946
What do you
expect me to do?

914
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,155
Go on living with a murderer

915
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,157
and take a chance on him
killing me, too?

916
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,575
No, I guess not.

917
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,869
I don't want you
to get mixed up in this.

918
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,997

for you. Joe Conroy.

speaks so pointedly to you

00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,139
about the Bennett case.

922
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,933
Why Kay was so upset

923
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,394
when she found out
about the monument.

924
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,981
But, above all,
you can't forget that diary.

925
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,733
What if Edith left behind
some entry

926
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,069
that would incriminate you?

927
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:23,499

LAURA:
I'm in the dining room.

929
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,969
Has Mrs Harrison come in
since I've phoned?

930
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,387
No, sir.

931
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,619
I thought it looked phoney
when he had Edith cremated

932
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,829
after she'd ordered
a gravestone for herself.

933
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:46,040
Yes, and that's what
started me wondering.

934
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:49,502
Does, er... cremation actually destroy
all evidence of poison?

935
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,087
No, that's a popular fallacy.

936
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,546
Quite a few killers
have been convicted

937
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,215
by a handful of ashes.

938
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,051
Well, it won't take long
to have this analysed.

939
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,720
You'll hear from me, Kay,
probably tonight.

941
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,688

I'm glad to see you're
feeling so much better.

I wish I felt up to it, but...

948
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,660
I couldn't have any fun
with this splitting headache.

949
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,454
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I'd forgotten about that.

950
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,082
I think I'll run upstairs
and take something for it.

951
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,834
Maybe you'll feel
like it later, huh?

01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,085

He's downstairs,
so it's all right to talk.

957
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,762
You were right, Kay.
He poisoned her.

958
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,347
The police are on their way
now to pick him up,

959
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,308
so make sure he doesn't
leave the house.

a little fling for myself.
