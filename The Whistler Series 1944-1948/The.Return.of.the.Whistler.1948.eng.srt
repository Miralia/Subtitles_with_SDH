of men and women

last night.

gone off duty. I'm afraid he's asleep.

a Mr Nichols here to see you.

149

He says it's very important.

150

-He says he'll be right down.
-Thanks.

Anderson.

153
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,115
What room
did you move my girl to?

154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,909
I didn't move her anyplace.

155
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,744
Now, don't you try to get me
mixed up in anything.

156

Oh, I get it. Well, forget about
the twenty. Where is she?

157
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,207
Well, how do I know
where she went?

158

159
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,210

Well, sure, about a half-hour
after you went away last night.

161
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,548
No, that's impossible.
She wouldn't do that.

162
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,217

I'm not gonna argue with you.

I'd like to get some sleep.

what you did with that girl.

-You're lying!

171
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,026
I don't know anything
about where she is!

172
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,819
Why, you..
You leave me alone!

173
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,863
Get him away from me!
He's crazy! He's crazy!

174
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,241
Let go of me.
I'll choke the truth out of him.

175
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,951
What's the trouble?

176
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,410
(EXHALING SHARPLY)

177
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,121
I don't know, Mr Hart.

178
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,873
I rented a room
to his girl last night,

179
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,459
and she checked out
and gave him the slip, and...

180
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,503
-Now he's trying to blame me for it.
-I mean, that's a lie.

181
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,214
-My girl wouldn't do a thing like that.
-I'll handle this.

182
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,259
How could you rent her a room?
We had no vacancies last night.

183
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,053
Well, I felt sorry for the lady.
She looked so tired.

184
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,389
Almost like
she was gonna pass out.

185
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,849
And then I let her have the room
we were gonna paint.

186
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,018
It was strictly against
my orders to rent that room.

187
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,354
And strictly against the law
to pocket the twenty bucks I gave him

188
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,563
and not let her register.

189
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,649
That's why he's lying.
My girl didn't run away.

190
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,776
He's just trying to cover up
for some reason.

191
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,735
Well, he's out of his mind!

192
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,737
After he left, I took the register
down to her room,

193
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,030
and she signed it.

194
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,615
We can check up on that
easy enough.

195
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,492
Sure, and on
the twenty dollars, too.

196
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,327
It's entered in the books
and crossed off.

197
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,621
-Why?
-Oh...

198
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,082
Well, because she came to me

199
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,042
and said she had
to get back to the city.

200
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,044
Wouldn't I let her
have the twenty dollars

201
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,422
as she didn't have money
to pay her fare.

202
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,049
I should've chased them both out
when they came in.

203
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,509
Then I wouldn't be
in this trouble now.

204
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,927
Listen, you're gonna have
nothing but trouble, brother,

205
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,178
if you don't tell me
what you did with her.

206
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,597
Now, just a minute, just a minute.
We'd better let the police settle this.

207
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,434
-Well, that's fine with me.
-Crandall, call Captain Griggs

208
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,978
-and ask him to come over here right away.
-CRANDALL: Yes, sir.

209
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,438
Please step into my office.

210
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,898
And, Anderson,
you bring the register.

211
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,990
(INAUDIBLE)

212
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,290
Well, isn't that
the girl's signature?

213
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,542
Well, the way it's been
scratched out, I can't be sure.

214
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,252
You don't seem to be sure
about a lot of things.

215
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,754
You can't talk me
out of this, Captain.

216
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,339
I'm not trying to,

217
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,049
but Anderson here
explained everything.

218
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,259
But don't you understand?
It couldn't have happened that way.

219
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,802
Alice is a French girl. She...

220
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,721
She's only been
in this country a few weeks.

221
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,972
She wouldn't know where to go.

222
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,350
That still doesn't prove
Anderson's lying. Why should he?

223
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,477
Because he must have had something
to do with her disappearance.

224
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,519
Oh.

225
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,355
Well, if that's the way you feel,
are you prepared to file

226
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,440
a charge against him,
say, for abduction?

227
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,068
It's about the most serious charge
you can make against anyone,

228
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,320
and you might be laying yourself
open for a lot of trouble.

229
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,655
TED: I'm not accusing him of that,
but I've got to find Alice.

230
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,657
Well, you've certainly
gone about it the wrong way.

231
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,284
As a matter of fact,
Anderson has a pretty good case

232
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,411
of assault and battery against you.

233
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,373
I'll hold him if you want to
come down to headquarters

234
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,166
and sign a complaint.

235
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,710
Well, I'd just as soon
forget the whole thing

236
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,545
if he'll promise
to keep away from here.

237
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,880
Anderson's right, Captain.

238
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,257
It would be bad publicity
for the hotel.

239
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,134
They're being very kind
to you, Nichols.

240
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,803
Come on, let's go.

241
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,769
-Have you got a car?
-Yes, but it's being fixed.

242
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,606
-It won't be ready till nine o'clock.
-It's almost that now.

243
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,734
Now, look, I'd advise you not to go
back in there and create a disturbance.

244
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,986
You're getting off
plenty easy as it is.

245
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,448
(ENGINE STARTING)

246
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,623
A fella has to be careful
in some of these small towns.

247
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,084
-A stranger hasn't got a chance.
-Yeah.

248
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,044
Seems to me
you got a pretty rough deal.

249
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,546
How do you know
so much about it?

250
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,631
Well, I was in the lobby.
I heard the whole argument.

251
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,757
Guess this is the
first bit of excitement

252
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,050
they've had around here
for months.

253
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,511
It may seem funny to you,
but it's no joke to me.

254
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,055
Well, I meant no offence.
I'm really very sympathetic.

255
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,474
I only wish there was something
I could do to help ya.

256
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,018
No, thank you. I...
I've got a little time to kill.

257
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,646
I'd just as soon
work this out for myself.

258
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,535
How about a cup of coffee?
I'm sure you could use one.

259
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,786
No, thanks.

260
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,582
I can understand how you let
your emotions run away with you.

261
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,833
It's hard to make a man in love

262
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,793
believe that such a thing
could happen to him.

263
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,920
-What are you, a philosopher?
-(CHUCKLING)

264
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,381
I've been called many things,
but never that.

265
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,425
Well, I don't really care
what you are.

266
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,470
But get this straight.
Alice didn't run out on me.

267
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,889
I... I don't know
what happened to her,

268
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,433
but she certainly didn't leave
of her own accord.

269
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,602
Maybe not,
but I've been called in

270
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,520
on many cases to help find
a missing person

271
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,815
only to discover that he or she
didn't want to be found.

272
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,609
Now I get it.
You're a lawyer.

273
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,153
No, no.
I'm a private detective.

274
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,575
Glad to know you.

275
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,993
But I think
I'll handle this alone.

276
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,828
Now, wait a minute.
I'm not looking for a job.

277
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,288
You're having a pretty rough time.

278
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,665
and I thought you could
use a few friendly tips.

279
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,752
-If that's the way you feel about it...
-Oh, all right... Traynor.

280
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,465
Um... Now tell me, if you were I,
how would you go about it?

281
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,467
Well, first, I'd take
a photograph of Alice

282
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,594
to the
Bureau of Missing Persons.

283
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,262
By the way,
let's see what she looks like.

284
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,473
I... haven't got her picture
with me.

285
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,683
-A fine thing.
-You see, we left in a hurry.

286
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,310
But I know there are
several in my apartment.

287
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,436
-Where's that?
-Back in the city.

288
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,896
I'll get 'em right away.

289
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,898
My car ought to be
ready by now.

290
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,942
Oh, but, er...

291
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,194
Suppose Alice is still
in this town somewhere?

292
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,612
Mmm, never.

293
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,197
Whether she ran away
or whatever happened,

294
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,283
I'm sure you won't find her
around these parts.

295
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,203
Gotta admit,
you're a pretty convincing Joe.

296
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,621
(CHUCKLING)

297
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,334
Well, now, if you want me to help you,
I must know the facts.

298
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,254
Wasn't there anyone in this
country she knew beside you?

299
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,297
Sure, she had some in-laws.

300
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,632
Well, then, she was married?

301
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,968
-Yes, to an American flyer.
-Oh.

302
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,678
Oh, I know what you're thinking,
but you're wrong.

303
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,429
Her husband's dead.

304
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,597
You see, er...

305
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,975
Alice wasn't just
a starry-eyed kid.

306
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,726
Life had kicked her around
quite a bit.

307
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,854
Yeah, stick to the facts, Ted.
Now, who are these in-laws?

308
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:45,897
Er...

309
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,149
Well, I never asked her
and she never told me.

310
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,484
(GRUNTING)

311
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,237
-When did you meet her?
-About two weeks ago.

312
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,863
-What?!
-Oh, I...

313
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,324
I know that sounds
pretty sudden, but...

314
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,578
sometimes you can live
a lifetime in two weeks.

315
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,246
That's the way
it seemed to me.

316
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,956
Well, after fifteen years
of marriage,

317
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,416
I can understand that.

318
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,168
Now, tell me, how did this
two weeks of a lifetime start?

319
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,506
I was staying for the weekend
at my cabin on Lake Shawnee.

320
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,968
It was Sunday night,
my last night there.

321
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,470
My pipe was drawing well

322
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,889
and I was listening
to the hundred different sounds

323
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,933
you hear in the country
at night, when...

324
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,270
suddenly, I heard someone
walking through the brush.

325
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,688
(SOFT RUSTLING)

326
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,317
Hello! Who's there?

327
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,332
ALICE:
Here! Over here, please!

328
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,462
What happened?

329
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,838
My ankle.

330
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,632
-Let me see.
-Oh!

331
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,842
-You're hurting me.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

332
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,595
But I don't think it's broken.
Probably sprained.

333
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,513
Perhaps I can
try again to stand on it.

334
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,641
No, you'd better not.
Where do you live?

335
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,809
Oh, no, I...
I don't wanna go back there.

336
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,729
Well, you certainly won't
get far on that ankle.

337
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,315
Please, if you could just help me
to the bus station.

338
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,234
-I must get to the city.
-No, you'll never make a bus now.

339
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,780
Besides, that ankle needs attention.
It's starting to swell.

340
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,865
What can I do?

341
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,451
Well, I can take you
to my place. It's close by.

342
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,120
I'll strap up the ankle
so you can walk on it.

343
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,997
Oh, I don't know what to do.

344
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,707
It'll be all right, really.

345
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,042
You take the little bag.

346
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,586
Now, put your arm round
my shoulder. Go ahead.

347
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,341
There we go, up easy.

348
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,344
-(GASPING)
-All right? There.

349
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,640
And from that moment on,
I was sunk.

350
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,809
I couldn't help feeling
there was something

351
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,186
almost symbolic
in the way I found her,

352
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,396
the way she came to me.

353
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,980
The facts, Ted, the facts.

354
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,316
Those are facts,
the way we felt.

355
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,569
You mean the way you felt,
like a kid picking up a stray cat.

356
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,863
Don't you have
any heart at all?

357
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,950
Never mind about me.
What happened next?

358
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,786
When we got to my cabin,
I bandaged her ankle.

359
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,335
I'm so grateful to you...

360
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,963
but now I must be leaving.

361
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,715
Now, stay off that foot!

362
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,717
You wanna start up
that swelling again?

363
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,302
You stay right here,
and I'll fix an ice pack.

364
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,098
ALICE: You're going to
so much trouble, monsieur.

365
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,184
TED: Let's drop the formalities.
The name's Ted. Ted Nichols.

366
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,228
-What's yours?
-Alice.

367
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,106
Aleece? Oh, Alice.

368
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,358
That's a beautiful name.
Alice what?

369
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,735
Alice Dupres.

370
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,157
Here we are.

371
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,577
You're taking
such fine care of me.

372
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,245
You must be a doctor.

373
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,997
No, an engineer.

374
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,583
But I'd certainly enjoy
pinch-hitting for a doctor.

375
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,753
You would make a very good one.
You know something?

376
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,046
-What?
-I feel all better already.

377
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,382
Oh, that's fine. But, er...

378
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,675
considering
the state of your health

379
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,844
and the fact there are
no more buses tonight, I...

380
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,679
Oh, no, I can't stay here.

381
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,057
Oh, now, look,
Miss Dupres, let's be sensible.

382
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,393
There's a beautiful bedroom in there,
and it's all yours.

383
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,978
In the morning,
I'll drive you into the city.

384
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,689
-I'm going in anyway.
-All right, I'll stay.

385
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,525
On one condition.
I sleep right here.

386
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,828
-There.
-But I don't want to put you out.

387
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,538
Please don't be difficult.

388
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,248
I'll get your bag.

389
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,833
Thank you, Ted.

390
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,422
And the way she said my name, I...

391
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,300
knew I wanted to go on
hearing her say it the rest of my life.

392
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,469
You got it bad, son.

393
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,554
The next day,
she felt lots better.

394
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,223
I took her into town with me.

395
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,683
She spent the day
looking for a place to live.

396
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,852
And that night,
she came back to you.

397
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,729
Because there wasn't
a single room to be had

398
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,272
in the entire city.

399
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,899
That's right.

400
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,651
But don't you believe
she told me the truth?

401
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,236
Why should I?

402
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,155
All it actually proves
is that you're a soft touch.

403
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,324
But go on. Let's hear
how she spellbound you

404
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,034
with her domestic skill.

405
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,411
Well, as a matter of fact,
she did cook

406
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,413
-and keep the apartment clean. She...
-(CHUCKLING)

407
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,874
...figured that was
the least she could do.

408
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,961
Mm-hmm, I bet she could whip up
a terrific onion soup.

409
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,548
-Hey, how do know all this?
-It's the pattern, my boy.

410
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,842
Then maybe this
will convince you

411
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,262
that she's not the kind of a girl
you still take her to be.

412
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,851
Is there anything
you can't cook to perfection?

413
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,436
Papa insisted
that I know how to cook.

414
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,565
He used to say that
there was no other pleasure

415
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,401
that lasted a man
from his birth to his death.

416
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,903
Know something, Alice?

417
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,905
You've got
just about everything.

418
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,458
Alice, what's the matter?

419
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,168
Anything I've done?

420
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,461
Yes.

421
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,132
You've been too kind to me,
and I don't deserve it.

422
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,510
Ted, I've made up my mind.

423
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,053
I'm leaving tomorrow.

424
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,222
I'm going back to France.

425
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,685
I'm lost here in this country.

426
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,521
It frightens me.

427
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,524
Now, you listen to me.

428
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,277
Today I had an offer
from a firm in Brazil.

429
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,863
I leave in two weeks.
I'll be gone six months.

430
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,489
Now, tell me,

431
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,241
what's wrong
with you staying here

432
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,202
and taking care of this place
till I come back?

433
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,414
In the meantime, you can look
for work, do anything you wish.

434
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,958
That's the trouble, Ted.

435
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,668
You want to do so much,

436
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,087
and you don't even know
anything about me.

437
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,049
I know everything about you
I want to.

438
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,260
You never even asked me what
I was running away from that night.

439
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,263
Well, I'm sure if you wanted me
to know, you'd have told me.

440
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,140
You have a right to know.

441
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,683
Why?

442
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,396
I was in love once
with an American soldier,

443
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,023
a transport pilot.

444
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,657
He was killed in France
the night we were married.

445
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,745
About six months ago,
my mother passed away.

446
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,041
I was left alone
with nothing but sad memories.

447
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,919
My life became unbearable.

448
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,757
So I decided
to come to America.

449
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,801
My husband had told me
to go to his father

450
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,844
if anything happened to him.

451
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,721
Well, why didn't you go there?

452
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,306
His father had died.

453
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,393
There were other relatives.
An aunt, some cousins.

454
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,895
I never felt at ease with them.

455
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,648
Then, one night,
when I was alone in the house,

456
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,567
one of them came back,
and he...

457
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,112
Oh, I couldn't stand that.

458
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,780
I had to run away.

459
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,616
Oh, I don't even want
to think about it.

460
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,576
It's like a bad dream.

461
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,911
(SOBBING)
Oh, Ted.

462
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,330
Of course you don't have
to think about it, darling.

463
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,541
Although, in a way,
I'm glad it happened.

464
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,584
Otherwise,
I'd never have met you.

465
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,381
Now, speaking of dreams,

466
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,216
don't you think
you'd better get to bed?

467
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,594
Yes, it is getting late.

468
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,139
-Hadn't we better flip?
-Hmm?

469
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,641
-You know, heads and tails.
-Yeah.

470
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,398
-Heads again.
-And you win again.

471
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,191
Well, I win every night.

472
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,776
You have very bad luck.

473
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,945
Good night, Ted.

474
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,334
You know, I think I'm
very fortunate to have met you.

475
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,763
I can't go on like this.

476
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,723
That is why I must leave.

477
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,349
Will you marry me?

478
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,310
Marry you?

479
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,854
But I've only just met you.

480
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,230
You don't know me.

481
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,732
Please, Alice.

482
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,151
You couldn't love me so soon.

483
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,528
You feel sorry for me
because I'm alone.

484
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,946
You pity me.

485
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,032
But pity isn't love.

486
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,703
And she went on that way,
trying to convince me

487
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,872
that I was mistaking
pity for love.

488
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,959
That pity was a terrible thing
because it meant that you...

489
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,129
looked down upon a person
as weaker than yourself.

490
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,508
And when I would finally realise that,
I'd begin to hate her.

491
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,052
-She was right.
-No, she was wrong.

492
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,221
I didn't pity her
in the least.

493
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,140
She was my idea
of an ideal woman.

494
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,685
I'm telling you all of this
only to prove that

495
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,063
marriage was my idea.
I'm the one that insisted.

496
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,357
She fought it
every step of the way.

497
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,150
Does that sound like
the kind of a girl

498
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,610
who was trying to take me?

499
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,488
Mmm, she might be
extremely clever.

500
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,073
Now I give up.

501
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,076
And she never mentioned
the name of her in-laws to you?

502
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,619
Not that I remember.

503
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,164
Doesn't that strike you
as being somewhat strange?

504
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,541
Not particularly.

505
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,627
After the first time, we didn't
talk about them again.

506
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,795
Hmm.

507
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,422
Anything else
you can recall about her?

508
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,800
Oh, wait.

509
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,054
There was one other thing
that happened later that same night.

510
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,649
(SCREAMING)

511
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,068
Alice!

512
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,447
-(SCREAMING)
-Alice, what's wrong?

513
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,079
-What's the matter?
-A man. Through the window.

514
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,092
There's no-one there.
What happened?

515
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,553
But I saw him.
He was going through my things,

516
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,764
and when I screamed,
he went out through the window.

517
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,265
Sure you weren't dreaming?

518
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,808
Oh, but no.
I tell you, I saw him.

519
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,894
Well, if there was a man,
you certainly frightened him away

520
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,770
when you screamed.

521
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,313
Oh, but you're laughing at me.

522
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,481
No, I'm not.

523
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,066
Look, I locked the window.

524
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,692
Try to get some sleep, huh?

525
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,989
Good night, darling.

526
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,374
I still don't know
if that really happened

527
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,042
or if it was only a bad dream.

528
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,128
She just had a nightmare
and too many crêpes Suzettes.

529
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,631
And now, I'm gonna
make you a prediction.

530
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,425
When we reach your apartment,
you'll find a note

531
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,386
and all her things gone.

532
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,639
Well, be that as it may,
I've still got to find her.

533
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:53,332
-Morning, George.
-Welcome back, Mr Nichols.

534
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,544
-Where's the missus?
-Er... She stayed up at the lodge.

535
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,962
I had to come into town
for a few hours,

536
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,505
take care of some business.

537
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,881
Any mail for me?

538
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,592
Nope. Not a thing, Mr Nichols.

539
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:04,927
Thanks.

540
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,641
So far, I'm fifty percent wrong.

541
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,476
It'll be an even hundred
before another minute.

542
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,187
-Wanna bet?
-Uh-uh. Now you'd have to give me odds.

543
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,157
Everything just as it was
when Alice and I left here.

544
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,200
-Hmm.
-Come on.

545
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,336
Now who's right?

546
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,463
Okay, okay.
I'll take it all back.

547
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,090
Now, get me her picture
and I'll go to work.

548
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,558
Here, take your choice.

549
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,855
-This her husband with her?
-Yes.

550
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,191
That was taken
the day of their marriage.

551
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,992
Look what I found, Traynor.

552
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,162
Her marriage certificate.

553
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,082
That's her married name, see?
It's Barkley.

554
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,167
And her husband's name
was John.

555
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,211
Barkley.

556
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,006
Barkley. Where have
I heard that name before?

557
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,969
(SNAPPING FINGERS)
I've got it.

558
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,889
Lake Shawnee. It's that
big place near the water.

559
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,599
The Barkley house,
they call it.

560
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,893
Now I'm beginning
to understand a few things.

561
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,813
It must have been the Barkley
house she was running away from.

562
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,980
And that cousin.

563
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,441
Maybe he had something
to do with her disappearance.

564
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,693
Come on, Traynor.
Let's get up there and find out.

565
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,195
Wait a minute, Nichols.

566
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,658
What is it?

567
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,092
THE WHISTLER: You walked
right into that one, didn't you?

568
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,303
But now, at least,
you know just where you stand.

569
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,974
There are others, shall we say,
interested in Alice.

570
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,434
And that marriage certificate

571
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,686
must be of great importance
to someone.

572
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,021
That's why Traynor went
to all this trouble

573
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,273
to get it away from you.

574
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,191
You're on your own now, Ted,

575
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,569
and with no time to spare.

576
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,747
The man I came in with,
did you see him leave?

577
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,083
Why, yes, about ten minutes ago.

578
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,418
Did he say anything to you?

579
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,172
No. He asked, er...
He asked me to call him a cab.

580
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,257
Seemed in a hurry.
Is there anything wrong?

581
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,217
There sure is.

582
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,889
Yes, sir, what is it?

583
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,141
I want to see Mr Barkley,
and don't tell me he isn't home.

584
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,518
Well, now...

585
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,521
What's the meaning of this,

586
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,481
forcing your way
into a strange home?

587
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,359
Never mind. Just tell Barkley
that Ted Nichols is here.

588
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,902
What is it, Mother?

589
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,195
Mother?

590
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,656
This is Mr Nichols, son.

591
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,699
He insists on seeing you.

592
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,662
So you're Barkley.

593
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,413
What did you do with Alice?

594
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,832
Please.

595
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,459
Please, young man.

596
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,753
You don't realise
what you're doing.

597
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,965
This is her husband,
Alice's husband.

598
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,800
Her husband? You?

599
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,553
No, no. No, that can't be.
That's a lie.

600
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,221
Be careful what you say.

601
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:20,057
But Alice told me
that her husband was dead.

602
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,935
Yes, I know. Killed in France
on her wedding night.

603
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,020
And, after the war, she came here
to live with my father,

604
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,605
but found he had died.

605
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,482
That's what she told you,
isn't it?

606
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,734
Yes, that's just what she said.

607
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,611
I really don't owe you
any explanation,

608
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,904
but, under the circumstances,

609
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,781
I suppose
you have a right to know,

610
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,825
providing you put that gun away.

611
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,037
Mother, I can handle this alone.

612
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,709
-Cigarette?
-No.

613
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,462
I, er, met Alice in Normandy
shortly after the invasion.

614
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,714
I was in the Air Corps,

615
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,008
a transport pilot
for paratroopers.

616
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,221
To make it brief, we fell
in love and were married.

617
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,348
That same night, I left
for a run over Germany

618
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,600
and was knocked over.

619
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,935
There was a false report
of my death.

620
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,730
Under the shock and
the climax of weeks of strain,

621
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,732
Alice's mind snapped.

622
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,777
Oh, yes, she recovered,
except for occasional relapses

623
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,156
when she believes herself to be
a widow and free to marry again.

624
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,617
Yeah, that's what
she gave me to understand.

625
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,703
Oh, no doubt she did.
And made it sound very logical.

626
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,371
The only thing
that makes us realise

627
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,040
she's about to have
one of these spells

628
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,792
are her strange delusions
she's being mistreated at home.

629
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,629
That's exactly
what she told me.

630
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:36,050
And, er, she usually builds it up
into quite a tale of horror.

631
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,552
In spite of everything,
I don't believe a word of it.

632
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,054
I know you're lying.

633
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,514
Would you like to hear it
from her own lips?

634
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,099
You wouldn't dare.

635
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,142
Mother!

636
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,689
Would you come here
a minute, please?

637
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,192
Yes, John. What is it?

638
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,401
See if Alice is all right.

639
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,278
I wanna take
Mr Nichols up to see her.

640
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,782
Oh, but aren't you afraid
it might excite her too much?

641
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,909
I'm quite sure Mr Nichols
will have sense enough

642
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,827
not to upset her.

643
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,704
Very well.

644
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,123
I've been
thanking my lucky stars

645
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,793
that we found Alice
before it was too late.

646
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,462
It's a good thing that minister
wasn't at home last night.

647
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,256
Yeah. You know
all the details, don't you?

648
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,053
Couldn't be by any chance
you have a fellow called Traynor

649
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,805
-working for ya?
-Indeed I did.

650
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,515
He was the man
who traced Alice.

651
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,850
He checked with
the service station at the lake.

652
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,269
You stopped there for some gas
before driving back to town,

653
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,396
and the attendant knew you.

654
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,356
Then why didn't you
come to my apartment

655
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,108
instead of letting things
go this far?

656
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,443
Mother and I did
the moment Traynor phoned us

657
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,945
and gave us your address.

658
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,656
It had taken him quite a while
to locate you in the city.

659
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,074
We missed you by minutes.

660
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,326
It's a good thing you told the clerk
where you were going.

661
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,620
Still sounds screwy to me.

662
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,665
All right, John,
you may come up now.

663
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,557
Please remember,
you must only stay a minute.

664
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,989
Alice, darling, what's wrong?
What happened?

665
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,867
I'm sorry, Ted.

666
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,119
Please forgive me.

667
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,579
Forgive you?

668
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,957
Well, you don't mean you're
really married to that man?

669
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,878
Yes, I am his wife.

670
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,130
You said wanted to hear it
from her own lips.

671
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,256
Well, you have.

672
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,633
Now, will you be
good enough to leave?

673
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,643
I'll see Mr Nichols
to the door.

674
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,990
Arnold, you may come out now.

675
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,663
You'll forget in time.
Just keep yourself occupied.

676
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,665
Or, better yet,

Well, that takes care
of Mr Nichols.

687

If you'd stayed away from her
in the first place,

688
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,387
we wouldn't have had
all this trouble.

all that again.

but I've made up for it now.

You gotta hand it to Mom
for putting this over.

You realise, of course,
you made a mistake.

693

-I did?
-Sure. That dope's going to South America.

taken Alice with him.

in the first place.

-It's all right, Mr Barkley.

It's not your fault we were
so rudely interrupted by Mr Nichols.

Well, it's a good thing you got here first
and told us what to expect.

How's Mrs Barkley feeling now?

726
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,116
Did it upset her much
to see Nichols again?

No, she took it like a soldier,
but I'm glad it's over.

-Well, let's get down to points.
-Oh, sure.

This is what I got
from his apartment.

730
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,920
Well, she even took
our marriage licence with her.

731
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,839
Yeah, the funny part is, Nichols
didn't know your wife's married name

732
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,217
till he found that certificate
in his desk.

733

Poor fellow.
He has my sympathy.

Yeah, mine too.

take care of everything.

739
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,021
and I hope you'll call me again,
if I can be of service.

740
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,148
Well, that's not very likely.
You see, we're leaving here.

741

-Oh?
-We've sold this place

about the past.

did he?

746
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,505
Not in the least.
And look what he brought us.

that would've made it possible

Alice just told you,

you still can't go
to the police.

846
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,782
-Hello?
-Woodland Sanitarium?

847
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,993
I'd like to speak
to Dr Grantland, please.

848
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,327
Well, just a moment.

849
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,580
It's for you, Doctor,
on extension one.

850
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,460
Dr Grantland speaking.

851
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,086
Er... This is, um...

852
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,630
My name's Simpson,
Doctor, Howard Simpson.

853
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,883
You've been, er,
highly recommended to me,

854
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,217
and I'd like to
come over and see you.

855
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,261
What seems to be
your trouble, Mr Simpson?

856
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,389
I, er, have these pains
in the back of my head.

857
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,310
Oh, sure. I've had a physical
check-up, X-rays and everything.

858
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,061
Very well, then.
Drop in and see me tomorrow.

859
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,147
I'll put the nurse back on
to give you an appointment.

860
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,065
No, just a minute, Doctor.

861
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,609
Tomorrow might be too late.

862
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,111
Well, you see,
when I have these pains,

863
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,946
I have moments of despondency.

864
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,073
I'm afraid of what I might do.

865
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,701
As a matter of fact, I'm feeling
pretty low right now.

866
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,412
Then maybe you'd better
come over right away.

867
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,290
Well, thank you, Doctor.
Thank you very much.

TRAYNOR:
Come on, talk.

869
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,218
I tell you, I didn't have
anything to do with them people.

870
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,053
I don't know nothin'
about what they was doin'.

871
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,347
You mean you work right here
and don't know what was goin' on?

872
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,015
Nope, I steered clear of 'em.

873
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,184
I didn't like 'em any more
than old Ed Barkley did himself,

874
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,227
after he took 'em in.

875
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,896
-Ed Barkley? Who's he?
-He was John's father.

876
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,398
I'd been with him
since before John was even born.

877
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,609
John's father?
I never heard of him.

878
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,654
Well, you wouldn't,
because he's dead,

879
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,073
same as John,
who was killed in the war.

880
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,158
You say John was lost in the war?

881
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,576
That's right.

882
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,037
Oh. Well, who was the fellow
I talked to this afternoon?

883
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,206
Well, that's Charlie,
John's cousin.

884
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,709
What about the old lady
and the others?

885
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,461
She's Ed Barkley's
sister-in-law,

886
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,712
and them's her children.

887
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,632
They were the closest
livin' relations to the old man,

888
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:56,094
exceptin' this here
French girl, maybe,

889
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,471
seeing she's John's widow.

890
00:50:58,806 --> 00:50:59,973
Hmm.

891
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,725
Then this place
really belongs to her.

892
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,478
Come to think of it, mister,
you're about right.

893
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,898
Come on, Pop. You've got things
to tell the police.

00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,694
Oh, yes. Come in, please.

00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,074
Right this way.

-This is Mr Simpson, Dr Grantland.
-Oh, yes, Mr Simpson.

00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,126
-Sit down, won't you?
-Thank you.

900
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,254
I'm rather curious to know
who referred you to me.

901
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,048
Ah... Well, you...

902
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,592
You see, Doctor,
my home's in, er, Albany.

903
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,260
You came here
specially to see me?

904
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,137
No, not exactly.

905
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,805
I'm on my vacation.

906
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:23,848
See, for the past year,

907
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,517
I've been under the care
of Dr Abner Green.

908
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,102
Abner Green?

909
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,604
Never heard of him.

910
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,481
Well, er, he's heard of you.

911
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,566
He told me that
if I had one of my spells

912
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,819
while I was down here that
I was to contact you at once.

913
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:37,904
I see.

914
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,322
Very kind of him.

915
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,786
Where do you have those pains?

916
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,787
Right here.

917
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:49,123
Mm-hmm. Take off your coat.
I'll check up on your heart.

918
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,460
You know,
sometimes these symptoms

919
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,630
are merely indicative
of a nervous condition.

920
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,215
You don't seem like
the nervous type.

921
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,342
Well, looks are
sometimes deceiving, Doctor.

922
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,219
Yeah, I'm constantly
aware of that.

923
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:04,806

has those X-rays you spoke of?

-Oh-Oh, yes.
-Good.

on the phone for me.

while you're staying here.

carry it around for self-protection.

and try to relax.

We don't generally have
this kind of disturbance.

Woman must be pretty sick.

Yes, and just a young girl, too.
Very sad case.

to the man
we know is her husband.

948
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,805
I'm sorry, Mr Simpson. Maybe
I shouldn't have said anything.

949
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,182
Oh, that's all right.

950
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,434
Dr Grantland has
handled many cases like hers

951
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,603
and always with great success.

952
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,272
And I'm sure he'll take
good care of you too.

953
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,858
You'd better get to bed,
Mr Simpson.

954
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,861
I'll give you a complete
examination in the morning.

Is Mr Simpson's room ready?
Yes, I'm putting him in 207.

00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,449
Good. Did you bring
some things with you?

957
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,659
Well, no. You see, I didn't
expect I'd have to stay.

00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:51,329
Oh, that's all right.
We'll give you what you need.

959
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,455
This way, please.

Now, please don't worry.

00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,103

very soon.

some sleeping garments?

-Certainly.

-We can't get her to quiet down.

then starts all over again.

don't ever leave me again.

I know. I was too trusting.

986

But they came to me
to the hotel,

987
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:48,858
and begged me
to forget what happened,

988
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,109
said they would
take me to you.

989
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,444
We'd go home,
have a big wedding.

990

They must've given him plenty

991
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,740
to make up that phoney story
about you running out on me.

But never mind that now, darling.
Where are your clothes?

-Hurry up.
-Yes.

995
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,713

the last of her.

Mmm. We've just about time
to make the plane.

will be worried.

It couldn't be.

But if I hadn't told you
I was his wife,

they would have killed
both of us.

01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,964
Just a minute.
He doesn't deserve that.

1013
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,508
You'd be in a fine fix
if it wasn't for him.

1014
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,426
Well, I still don't know
whose side you're on.

1015
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,595
I can't blame you, Nichols.
I admit I made a mistake.

1016
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,056
-They certainly had me fooled.
-Okay, forget it.

1017
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,975
But that doesn't go
for that phoney doctor.

1018
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,727
I demand his arrest for keeping
Alice here against her will.

1019
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,021
This institution is
of high professional standing.

1020
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,523
When Mr Barkley
brought this lady here,

1021
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,899
he proved to me
that he was her husband.

1022
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,193
He had every legal right
to put her under my care.

1023
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,903
But I told you he was lying.

1024
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,822
And, in spite of that,
you didn't bother to find out

1025
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,241
whether he was actually the man whose
name appeared on the marriage licence.

1026
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,618
All right, cut out the arguing.
You're all going to the D.A.'s office.

1027
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,245
and you can
explain everything to him.

1028
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,372
Well, what about Mrs Barkley
and her other son and daughter?

1029
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,000
They'll be there
waiting for us. Come on.

1030
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,172
Oh, er, I almost forgot.

1031
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,424
There's a man locked up
in the closet of my room.

1032
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,885
You'd better let him out
before he suffocates,

1033
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,511
and I'm accused of murder.

1034
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,222
All right, let him out.

1035
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,143
Come on, Doc, you too.

1036
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,029
Pardon me, sweetheart,
if I've asked you this before.

1037
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,740
-Are you nervous?
-Not this time, darling.

1038
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:43,991
(CHUCKLING)

1039
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,961
THE WHISTLER:
You certainly were lucky, Ted.

1040
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,880
It might have
ended differently,

1041
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,674
with you and Alice
worlds apart.

1042
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:04,595
But fate, this time,
was on your side.

1043
