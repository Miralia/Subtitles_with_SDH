I am the Whistler.

And I know many things,
for I walk by night.

4
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,778
I know many strange tales hidden
in the hearts of men and women

who have stepped into the shadows.

You made this pretty strong.

-You want to know?

instead of that motor cop.

that ring on your finger.

Eileen's kiss on your lips,

toward everybody.

ask the guy that's riding with me.

must have been drunk.

that had one too many.

celebrate Eileen's birthday, didn't you?

Why, yes.
I had one drink. So what?

90
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,922
It's against the law for truck
drivers to drink on the job, Steve.

You know that.

If you want to be technical,
then I'm as sober as you are.

Well, you'll have to
convince the judge of that.

the rest of your story, too.

something about that crack.

that uniform I'd help you do it.

like this. Why didn't you brain him?

Charlie, I'm in enough trouble
without socking a cop.

108

At least it's a good thing
you're covered by insurance.

109

I don't dare let McCabe file a claim.

110

-Why not?
-If I do...

111
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,425
and I'm convicted of drunk driving,
they'll cancel my policy.

112
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,594
-And I'm out of the trucking business.
-Well, what can you do?

113
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,139
There's only one thing I can do
and that's to pay off.

114
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,558
I guess I can borrow
some money on the trucks.

115
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,769
-But you just got them free and clear.
-So what?

a little while longer. That's all.

has been unable to produce

121

a single witness
to verify any of his statements,

122
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,670
the court is forced to the conclusion

123
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,340
that the defendant was in no condition
to drive in a safe and sane manner

your sentence will be six months
in the county jail.

127
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,725
However, since this
is your first offence,

128
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,771
and since you've made a satisfactory
settlement with the innocent victim,

129
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,272
sentence is suspended,

130
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,734

your driver's licence be revoked

131
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,486

135
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,055
You're lucky he didn't send you to jail.
He could have, you know.

136
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,141
It'll be just as bad sitting around
for six months twiddling my thumbs

137
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,102
and paying somebody else
to drive for me.

-Skip it.

Okay, Bernie. I don't want
you to drive if you're sick.

170
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,327
Is the truck loaded?

171
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,581
Well, drive it over here.
Are you well enough to do that?

172
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,125
Okay, Bernie. Fine. Goodbye.

173
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,003
More bad luck. Bernie's sick.

174
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,213
Well...

175
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,131
Maybe you can get Thompson.

176

Hey, there's an idea.

177
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,137
Hadn't thought of him.

178
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,153
Well, that won't do me any good.

179
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,033
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
Drivers are hard to get at short notice.

180
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,326
Yeah. Goodbye.

-Hiya, Steve.
-Hello, Jerry.

182
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,040
Sorry to hear about that
raw deal Parker gave you.

183
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,500
Oh, not too sorry, I imagine.

184
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,418
Don't be like that, Steve.

185
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,546
What if we are competitors?
We can still be friends, can't we?

186
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,424
-If you want it that way.
-If I want it that way?

187
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,509
Look, fella.

188
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,845
I had all the trucking business till
you came along and started cutting rates.

189
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,514
Well, you were overcharging
your customers.

190
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,558
So what? Nobody squawked
till you stuck your nose in.

191
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,061
Oh, now let's not
go all over that again.

192
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,562
I got to get a load rolling.

193
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,273
All right, I'll make it brief.

194
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,899
I'd still like to buy you out.

195
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,651
The answer is still no.

196
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,153
Don't say no
till you hear my proposition.

197
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,406
I'll give you part of the business,

198
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,824
employment for you and Charlie,

199
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,285
and I'll assume the mortgages
you gotta place on your trucks.

200
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,620
I don't believe in Santa Claus.

201
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,788

202
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:10,998

203

in a lot of money in a few years.

207
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,507
Meaning what?

208
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,510
I've got a strange philosophy
of my own, Steve.

209
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,722
I always try to get what
I want in a nice way.

210
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:27,889

211
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,350
Well, I'm glad
we understand each other.

212
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,560

213
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,811

let you down if I wasn't sick as a dog.

00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,640
I know that, Bernie.

218
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,059
Go on home and get a doctor.

219
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,685
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

220
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,312
But I'll be back
as soon as I can make it.

221
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,521

If that load spoils,
I lose the account.

00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,872
-I can't afford that.
-Yeah, but if Don Parker spots you,

-you're out of the trucking business.
-No, he won't.

231
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,168
I'll wait till it's dark.
I'll stay off Highway 32.

00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:03,575
The guy had gone.

518
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,535
Killed Jerry and robbed his safe.

519
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,954
-But where was Charlie?
-He got it too.

520
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,456
They slugged him
and threw him in a car.

521
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,541
He was sticking
his neck out for me.

522
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,753
I'm in an awful jam, Eileen.

523
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,173
I'd be better off
if I give myself up

524
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,550
before they blame
this one on me, too.

525
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,636
Do you really mean that, Steve?

526
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,805
Give me the glove. I'll need it
when I tell my story to the police.

527
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,642
Are you sure
that's why you want it?

528
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,018
Of course. Why else?

529
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,604
I told you Steve didn't
know about it, Mom.

530
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,855
Know about what?

531
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,106
I'll show you.

532
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,839
STEVE:
Why, they're the real thing.

533
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,217
Am I stupid?

534
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,136
I've been looking for a
man with a missing thumb.

535
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,555
I guess you're just not
as curious as I am.

536
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,891
Why, these things are worth a fortune.

537
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,893
-I wonder...
-What?

538
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,230
I wonder if they're anything to do
with the police coming up here.

539
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,899
That's impossible. Nobody knew
about them but Tommy and me.

540
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,878
Tommy, what's got into you?

541
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,340
Mabel's been spying on us.

542
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,342
I caught her listening
at the door yesterday.

543
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,678
Now she's calling
somebody on the phone.

544
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,847
Do you think she's working
with the police?

545
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,057
Well, maybe. But my guess
is that she's in with the guy

546
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,600
that killed Jerry and Don.

547
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,437
How long has she been
working for you?

548
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,606
Well, I... I hired her about
a week after you left town.

549
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,985
Well, at that time the cops weren't
looking for me around here.

550
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,030
She must be in with the guy
that's after that glove.

551
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,450
She got a job here so she could
tip him off if I showed up.

553

He isn't feeling very well.

554
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,259
I wonder if I could get off now.

555
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,261
Of course, Mabel.
I'll be out in a minute or two.

556
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,512
Thanks a lot.

557
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,851
TOMMY:
She's lying, Mom.

558
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,522
Nobody called her.
I saw her dial a number.

559
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,524
Well, that proves it.

560
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,610
-May I borrow your car?
-What are you going to do?

561
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,944
I'm going to follow her.

562
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,822
I've got a hunch she's gonna meet her
boyfriend and give him the low-down.

563
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,533
What if they see you?
Why not let the police handle it?

564
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,911
But there is no time.
They might get away.

565
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,205
Get my keys, Tommy.
They're on the dresser.

566
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,999
Here. I want you to put
these diamonds away.

567
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,876
Put them in the glove
exactly as you found them.

568
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,836
I want to show them to the police.

569
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,132
But if Mabel knows about them,
it won't be safe to keep them here.

570
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,301
I guess I'd better
take them with me.

571
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,261
Here. Here.

572
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,555
I'll put them in here.

573
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,975
Gee, that's pretty smart.

574
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,687
-Now, you keep the glove until I need it.
-All right.

575
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,232
-Good luck, Steve.
-Thanks, pal.

take care of himself.

to worry about the diamonds.

All right.
How soon will you be home?

Well, you'd better
make it half an hour.

We've been on the wrong track.

-You do?
-Mabel's boyfriend.

-Mabel?
-The gal that works for Eileen.

-You sure of that?
-I'm positive.

Now, he'll be over at her place
in about a half an hour.

they're getting ready to leave town.

I don't understand.

Charlie and I...

653
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,861
walked into a trap.

do exactly...

00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,596
as I say.

00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,725

663
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,021
and don't call the police.

664
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,277
Now, sign your name.

665
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,308

about the diamonds?

667
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,562
But if you ask her to trade
an old glove for my life,

668
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:59,105
she'll think you're crazy.

669
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,898
-He's right, Charlie.
-Yeah.

670
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,984
Yeah. I guess he is.

671
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,237
You'd better find something
to tie him up with.

Sure. I'll be seein' ya.

-Steve sent me.

680
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,971
He's in trouble.

681
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,731
There's some cops hangin' around?

682
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,733

683
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,132

684
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,760
I think this'll explain it
better than I can.

685
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,853
And Steve and I didn't have sense
enough to take that glove apart.

686
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:03,646
Yeah.

687
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,649

actually had a thumb missing.

00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:16,617
Steve's in more trouble, dear.
Charlie just brought me a note from him.

690
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,704
Let me see it, Mom.

691
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,213
But, Mom, he says here that...

692
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,635
Well, that...

693
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,016
Go ahead.
What were you gonna say?

694
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,393
Steve says not to call the police.

695
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,146
But how do we know they'll let him go
after we give them the diamonds?

696
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:46,939
Yes. How do we know that?

697
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,192
They don't care a hoot about Steve.
They only want the diamonds.

698
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,736
I hope you're right.

699
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,071
Well, we'd better do
just as Steve says.

700
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,115
-But I'm going with you.
-Well...

701
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,324
Okay, but hurry up.

702
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,828
If those guys think I called the cops,
Steve's a dead pigeon.

703
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,421
You're a smart kid, Tommy.

704
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,214

How are we gonna get there?

706
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,763
I've got your car.
Steve told me to use it.

707
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,099
Good night, Tommy.

708
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,143
You must take care of
everything while I'm away.

709
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,312
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll take care of everything.

710
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,688
You got the glove?

711
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,065
Right here.

712
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,275
So long, Tommy. See ya later.

713
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,443
So long.

What'd you bring her for?

722
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:37,133
She just wanted to make sure this
stuff got into the right hands.

723
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,051
You shouldn't have
come here, honey.

724
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,721
It's all right, Steve.
He didn't fool me for a minute.

725
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,640
Smart girl.

726
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,184
Now, let's have that glove.

727
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,204
So you didn't know a thing
about the diamonds.

728
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,626
What did you do with 'em?

729
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,088
What did you do with 'em?!

730
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,008
He doesn't know where they are.

731
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,635
I've hidden them,
and you'll never find them.

I think I will.

733
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,266
Stop it.
I'll tell you where they are.

734
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,477
They're in my tobacco
pouch on the table.

Gee. Am I glad to see those
little beauties again!

736

-Are... Are they all there?
-Yeah.

737
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,956

to carry 'em.

Okay.

741

in the bedroom closet.

This is your lucky day, Reynolds.
Mabel's turned state's evidence.

760
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,615
Her story clears you of the
murder of Don Parker.

761
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,284
Did she tell you
about Jerry Mason?

762
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,661
Yes. She told us
he killed him, too.

763
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,748
We're rounding up the rest
of the Mason gang now.

764
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:00,044
Well, Charlie couldn't resist
the money in that safe.

765
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:03,172
I still don't understand the connection
between him and Don Parker.

766
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,965
Parker had been
a policeman back east.

767
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,508
It was through him
that Charlie was arrested

768
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,094
and sent up for the
Worthing diamond robbery.

769
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,763
But the gems were never recovered.

770
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,724
I remember reading about that case.
It was about four years ago.

771
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:14,933
That's right.

772
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:18,270
After Parker joined the force out here,
he accidentally ran into Charlie.

773
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,690
He figured that he still had
the diamonds stashed away.

774
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:23,484
Then he started blackmailing him?

775
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,694
Exactly.
It cost him his life.

776
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,696
It's unfortunate,

777
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:30,699
but, of the thousands of men
who enforce the law,

01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,409

779
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:35,162
Well, Captain,
I sure want to thank you.

780
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,789
Don't thank me. Thank that boy.

781
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,458
He gave us the licence
number of his mother's car.

782
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,543

we spotted it so quickly.

783

of everything, Mom.

784
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,672
I knew I could
depend on you, Tommy.

785
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,926
You know, Reynolds. There's a big reward
for the recovery of those diamonds.

786
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,428
-There is?
-Yes. And you're gonna get it.

787
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,473
And you're entitled to it
after what you have been through.

789
