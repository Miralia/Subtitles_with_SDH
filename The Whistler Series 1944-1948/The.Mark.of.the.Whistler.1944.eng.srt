THE WHISTLER:
I am the Whistler,

3
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,489
and I know many strange tales,

4
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,450
many secrets hidden
in the hearts of men and women

5
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,536
who have stepped
into the shadows.

6
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,789
Tonight, I am keeping
a strange rendezvous.

7
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,459
This man is a human derelict.

8
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,462
Broke, discouraged,
unable to hold a job

9
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,840
because of ill health.

10
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,385
His name is Lee Selfridge Nugent.

11
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,137
I knew him in better days,

12
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,390
when he possessed money,
power, influence.

13
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,521
But fate decreed that those
material things should slip away,

14
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,482
and that I, the Whistler,
should find him tonight,

15
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,819
alone in a strange city,
on this park bench.

16
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,156
What can the future hold
for a man like this?

17
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,109
Ironic, isn't it?

18
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,112
These people all have money
in the bank, waiting for them,

19
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,157
yet, for some reason,
they do not come to claim it.

20
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,704
Coincidence.
That's all it is.

21
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,540
You're not the Lee Nugent
they're looking for.

22
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,918
You are Lee Selfridge Nugent.

23
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,754
Your mother's name
was Mary, not Stella.

24
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,297
Forget about it.

25
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,184
Desperation prompts this man

26
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,396
to think that he can compromise
with his conscience.

27
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,107
We shall see how he fares.

00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,358
Strike him out, Herman!
He can't touch us! Strike him out!

31
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,693
It's a great game, isn't it?

32
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,361
Nah, it's awful.

33
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,030
Wish I could get in there.
I'd show 'em!

34
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,532
I'll bet you would.

35
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,825
Do you watch 'em
play every day?

36
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,078
Sure. Except on the days
when I have to go to the clinic.

37
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,917
Gee, thanks!

38
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,961
Herman!

39
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,297
That's Herman.

40
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,674
-That was a good throw.
-Thanks.

41
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,717
You know something?

42
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,052
At the clinic yesterday,
a lady from Australia

43
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,722
told me that, maybe next year,
I could walk.

44
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,099
And, after that,
maybe, if I exercised right,

45
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,768
I could even play ball.

46
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,978
-Say, wouldn't that be somethin'?
-I'll say!

47
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,773
Say, where did the kids play ball
before the building was torn down?

48
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,983
What building?

49
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,152
Wasn't there a building on this lot?

50
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,863
No.
It's always been just a lot.

51
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,200
Oh.

52
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,659
Well, goodbye, son.

53
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,453
You're gonna be
a great ball player some day.

54
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,788
Thanks.

00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,207

Give him another fast one!

56
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,042

00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,836
Good morning.

If you're lookin' for a vacancy,
there ain't any.

59
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,465
If you're sellin' something,
I won't buy it.

60
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,966
And if you're beggin',
you can just run along.

61
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,468
There's plenty of work
for those that want it.

62
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,928
I was wondering about
that vacant lot.

63
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,096
How long was that building
torn down that was on it?

64
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,890
Wasn't torn down, it burned down.

65
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,475
Burned down, huh?
How long ago was that?

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,185
Oh, long before
I moved in this block,

67
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,103
and I've lived here
for twenty years.

68
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,189
Say, you ain't one of them
carnival fellas that's plannin'

69
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,983
on puttin' one of them noisy
merry-go-rounds on that lot, are ya?

70
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,276
I warn ya, I won't stand for it.

71
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,237
I had the police
on the last one that tried it.

72
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,988
Madam, I assure you,
I'm not interested

73
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,366
in putting a merry-go-round
on that lot.

74
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,285
But I am considering it
for a shooting gallery.

75
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,424
-Nice dog you got here.
-Yeah.

76
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,802
Mike's a swell dog.
Intelligent, too.

77
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,387
Yeah? Hello, Mike.

78
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,055
You know, he knows
quicker than we do

79
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,807
when our number
comes on the alarm bell.

00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,062
-Yeah.
-Hiya, Mike.

83
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,647
Any big fires lately?

84
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,316
No. Been kinda dull lately.

85
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,987
Last big one was that
Acme Warehouse fire, about a year ago.

86
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,197
They tell me you had
a big one, a real big one,

87
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,824
down here some time ago.

88
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,660
Read Street, apartment building.
It's probably before your time.

89
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,122
Oh, no. I remember it
just like it was yesterday.

90
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:13,914
Yeah?

91
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,208
-Seven people died in that fire.
-Seven?

92
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,503
Yeah. Three of 'em missed the net
when they jumped from the sixth floor.

93
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,338
Awful mess.

94
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,049
Read Street? That used to be
a fashionable neighbourhood.

95
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,718
Not tenements, like it is now.

96
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,387
Oh, well, you know.
Time changes neighbourhoods.

97
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,723
How long ago was that, exactly?

98
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,308
I never forget a big one.

99
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,020
That was October.
Early October, 1912.

100
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,230
-Long ago as that, huh?
-Yup.

101
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,357
I was sittin' right here,
in front of the old firehouse,

102
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,360
just as I am now,
readin' the political news

103
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,362
when the alarm came in.

104
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,822
That was the year that, er...

105
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,366
Woodrow Wilson, Bill Taft
and Teddy Roosevelt

106
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,702
were all havin'
a battle royal for President.

107
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,081
The Democratic jackass outrun
Taft's elephant and Teddy's bull moose,

108
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,917
and Wilson was elected.

109
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,377
Doggonest political fight you ever saw.

110
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,131
Reckon you don't remember
much about that campaign, do ya?

111
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,841
1912?

112
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,636
Well, I was just a boy
at the time. Er...

113
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,930
Twelve years old,
to be exact.

114
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,308
Yeah, I...
I was just twelve years old.

115
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,025
That's the file of the Daily Register
for October 1912.

116
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,736
-I hope it helps you.
-I hope so.

117
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,092
Did you find what you wanted?

118
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,428
Exactly what I wanted.
Thank you.

119
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,185
I hardly think I can help you
locate Lee Nugent.

120
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,396
Our records show
he was placed in a private home,

121
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,065
six months after the death
of his mother and sister.

122
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,068
Have you the name and address
of the people who gave him a home?

123
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,236
Yes, I do.

124
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,238
A Mr and Mrs Henry Carlson.

125
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,743
They lived at 1 1816
Runnymede Street,

126
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,911
but this information
is of little value.

127
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,665
Lee ran away from home,
the Carlson home, in 1915,

128
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,292
and hasn't been heard of since.

129
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,836
Mr and Mrs Carlson
died some years ago.

130
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,129
I see.

131
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,006
About Lee's father...

132
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,758
Have you any information
regarding him?

133
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,177
Only that he and Mrs Nugent
were separated,

134
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,055
and an effort was made
to find them in 1912,

135
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,183
when the boy became
a ward of this society.

136
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,811
Er... There is a notation here
that he was reported to be

137
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,730
somewhere in South America
at the time.

138
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,399
I'm sorry I can't give you
any more information.

139
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,942
Well, you've been very kind.

140
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,528
-Thank you very much.
-You're quite welcome.

141
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,428
You want somethin', brother?

142
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,971
Depends on how much
of a gambler you are.

143
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,056
I never gamble.

144
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,350
If it's a suit you want,
I can sell it to you cheap.

145
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,477
-But for cash.
-Oh, I haven't any cash at the moment.

146
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,853
Then come back
the moment you have it.

147
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,023
Well, that won't do. I have to
have a suit in order to get the cash.

148
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,525
-Let me show you something.
-If it ain't cash,

149
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,527
-I don't wanna look at it.
-Yeah, but look this over.

150
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,821
This is good for cash.
Maybe a lot of it. Now, look.

151
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,572
All I see is a piece of
old newspaper,

152
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,907
and for that you'll get
no suit in this store.

153
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,158
Now, do me a favour,
and go away.

154
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,244
Okay, if you're not interested
in making a hundred percent profit

155
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,246
on a very small investment,
I'll find somebody who is.

156
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,831
Wait a minute, brother.

157
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,166
Did you say,
"a hundred percent"?

158
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,543
Yes.

159
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,753
On, er...
how small an investment?

160
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,172
The price of a suit, and
enough money for food and lodging

161
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,716
in a cheap hotel, until I can
claim a dormant account

162
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,010
that's waiting for me
at the Standard Savings Bank.

163
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,095
Here, look...

164
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,305
Here's my name on the list
in their advertisement.

165
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,974
-Mm-hmm.
-You can't lose.

166
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,184
How do I know
you are Lee Nugent?

167
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,645
The government says I am.

168
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,814
Here's my social security card.

169
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:49,982
-See?
-Mmm.

170
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,900
The whole gamble amounts to
about sixty dollars.

171
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,902
Twenty dollars for the suit,

172
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,238
for expenses,
until I claim the account.

173
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,573
Mm-hmm.

174
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,658
What if there ain't
sixty dollars in the account?

175
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,034
Oh, but there's sure to be.
It says right there

176
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,494
that every account's
over a hundred dollars.

177
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,371
Come on, give me a suit
and forty dollars in cash,

178
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,498
and I'll get a cheap hotel room.

179
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,708
Oh, no.

180
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,501
You'll take no
forty bucks of mine.

181
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,171
If I'm going into this thing,
I gotta protect my investment.

182
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,256
In a hotel, I might not find you
when you get the money.

183
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,465
If you get it.

184
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,176
I got an apartment upstairs.

185
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,719
You'll move in with me.

186
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,846
Then, if you don't get the money,
you give me back my suit,

187
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,848
and all I'm out's
the food you eat while you're here.

188
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,392
That's my final proposition.
Take it or leave it, brother.

189
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,978
You're a shrewd trader,
but it's a deal.

00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,490
-Yeah, to mail a letter.
-I'll go with ya.

00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,701
Oh, yes, good idea.

Er... You-You can keep
an eye on your suit.

I haven't any money
for a postage stamp.

Oh, you can get me a packet
of cigarettes, too, huh?

Okay, brother, I'm ready.

200
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,409
-Good morning, Mr Sorsby.
-Good morning. Got a letter for me?

201
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,120
No, there's one here
for a man named Lee Nugent,

202
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,456
in care of you.
Er... Do you know him?

203
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,291
Yeah, he-he's staying
with me for a while.

204
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,377
-I'll see that he gets it.
-Oh, okay.

205
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,649
A letter came for ya.

206
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,026
Put it on the table in the living room.
I'll get it later.

207
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,487
Listen, brother, how come
you get mail at my place

208
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,072
and I only met you yesterday?

209
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,116
Well, it could be that
I told some friends of mine

210
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,451
-that I'd be stopping here with you.
-What friends?

211
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,161
You ain't talked to nobody
since we made our deal.

212
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,039
-Oh, that was before I met you.
-Before you met...

213
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,208
Sure, I knew that we'd
shake a deal.

214
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,793
You got a reputation
in the neighbourhood, you know,

215
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,337
of always being willing to spend
a dollar in order to make two.

216
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,506
Yeah?
Well, get this straight, Nugent.

217
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,758
I don't trust ya, and I'm
protectin' my investment.

218
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,302
When you walk outta here
with that suit of mine

219
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,345
to go to the bank,
I'm going right along with it.

220
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,557
Good idea. We'll all three go.
You, me, and the suit.

221
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,683
Only when we get to the bank,

222
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,352
I'll have to ask you
to wait outside. You're, er...

223
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,397
You're not exactly
the prepossessing type, you know.

224
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,334
Well, this is as far as you go.

225
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,711
Well, why can't I wait
just outside the bank?

226
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,795
Say, listen,

227
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,131
it's gonna be tough enough for me
to convince them that I'm Lee Nugent

228
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,924
without you hangin' around
to spoil everything.

229
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,427
But I can identify ya.
I'm a legitimate businessman.

00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,887
You're staying at my apartment.

231
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,388
If I go in with you,
it'll help your claim.

232
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,515
Now, play it my way if you
want double your money back.

233
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,602
Okay. But I'll be watching
that bank door every minute.

to window number three.

dormant accounts you're advertising.

238
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,802
Right over at that desk, sir.
Mr Simmons will take care of you.

239
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,220
Thank you.

240

Take those drafts upstairs
and check on those other accounts.

00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,643
I'll call you later.

242
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,688
-Mr Simmons?
-Yes. May I help you?

243
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,233
I think you can. I'm...
I'm Lee Nugent.

244
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,695
Come in, Mr Nugent.

245
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,575
Won't you sit down?

246
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,285
Thank you.

247
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,705
I presume you're here
to discuss the dormant account

248
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,249
listed in our advertisement?

249
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,126
Well, that's the general idea.

250
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,794
Naturally, we will require proof

251
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,879
that you are the beneficiary
named in the account.

252
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,090
-Mm-hmm.
-Have you any identification?

253
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,467
Well, some. I have, er...

254
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,595
Oh, I have my social security card,
and, er...

255
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,182
here's a pawn ticket
for a ring, and, er...

256
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,435
a letter from a friend of mine.

257
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,437
But haven't you anything more?

258
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,022
We can't turn over
a sum of money to you

259
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,358
merely on the strength
of a letter,

260
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,319
a pawn ticket,
and a social security card.

261
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,865
No, I...
Have you any suggestions?

262
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,492
I'll get the file on the account.

263
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,495

Oh, I... I was just
curious about that siren.

270
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,168
Oh, an ambulance.

271
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,003
Yes, they go by the bank
quite often.

272
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,922

a few blocks up the street.

Er, Mr Nugent...

274
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,343
Have you anyone
to vouch for you?

275
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,429
Someone of standing
whom you've known for some time?

276
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,931
I'm afraid I haven't.

277
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,642
Certainly someone must have
known you over a period of years?

278
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,435
Well, I can't think of anyone.

279
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,479
See, I ran away from home
when I was only fifteen.

280
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,733
I didn't have much of an education.
Had to take any job that came along.

281
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,693
Won't you sit down?

282
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,365
What kind of jobs?

283
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,158
Anything to make a living.

284
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,453
Harvesting in Kansas,
lumbering in the North Woods.

285
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,374
worked on a construction gang,
even down at the docks now and then.

286
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,085
I'm what I guess
you'd call a floater.

287
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,962
When a fellow's a floater, he...

288
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,421
well, he really hasn't got a name.

289
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,757
I almost forgot
what my last name was.

290
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,968
People just called me "Lee",
and let it go at that.

291
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,344
I see.
(CHUCKLING)

292
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,596
You say this letter
is from a friend of yours.

293
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,473
-Mind if I read it?
-Oh, please do. I...

294
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,060
Afraid it won't be of much help.
He was a floater, like myself.

295
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,854
Only difference was,
he had a college education.

296
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,856
Told me he was going to
write a book sometime.

297
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,401
Always packed
a portable typewriter with him.

298
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,368
"Slim."
What's the man's last name?

299
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,621
Well, I don't know and,
to tell you the truth,

300
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,582
he never told me.

301
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,626
This letter's absolutely worthless
for identification.

302
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,129
I was afraid it
wouldn't be much help.

303
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,965
You say you ran away from home
when you were fifteen. Why?

304
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,717
Were your parents cruel to you?

305
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,844
Oh, I wasn't living with
my parents at the time.

306
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,388
I was living with some people
by the name of Carlson.

307
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,016
I remember they lived
on Runnymede Street.

308
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,392
Where were your parents?

309
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,728
Well, my mother and sister
were killed in a fire.

310
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,896
I don't know where my dad was.

311
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,107
My mother and father
weren't living together.

312
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,067
It seems to me
as though I remember

313
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,653
my mother said something
about his being in...

314
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,864
-South America.
-When were you born?

315
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,408
Well, I can't tell you that exactly.

316
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,411
I suppose my mother told me,
but kids forget things.

317
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,831
I was, er... twelve years old
at the time of the fire.

318
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,083
-When was that?
-In October 1912.

319
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,546
Where was this house of yours?
You say it burned down.

320
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,965
Oh, it wasn't a house.
It was an apartment building.

321
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,009
295 Read Street.

322
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,011
Oh, I remember it very vividly.

323
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,055
I had to jump from the sixth floor.

324
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,848
A thing like that
sticks with a fella.

325
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,559
I can readily see how it would.

326
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,772
You say your younger sister
died in the fire?

327
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,775
Well, she wasn't younger.

328
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,443
She was three years older
than I am.

329
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,528
And I suppose
you remember her name?

330
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,864
Sure, sure. Dorothy.

331
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,660
How long have you known about
the existence of this file?

332
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,037
Well, only since yesterday.

333
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,332
It was strictly accidental.
I happened to see your ad,

334
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,750
and I thought,
"well, isn't that queer,

335
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,629
"that the bank are trying to
find people to give money to?"

336
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,214
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

337
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,049
Then I saw my mother's name,
and mine.

338
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,759
You were very fortunate.

339
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,053
-You mean I get the money?
-(CHUCKLING)

340
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,596
Not yet.

341
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,140
Naturally, the bank will have to
conduct an investigation.

342
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,267
Naturally, but, er...

343
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,811
how soon do I get it?

344
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,313
You'll be notified within five days.

345
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,524
I take it this is your
correct mailing address?

346
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,234
Yes, that's...

347
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,486
correct. How much money
is there in the account?

348
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,697
I'm not permitted
to disclose the amount

349
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,782
until the investigation is completed.

350
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,992
Well, that doesn't tell me
very much, does it?

351
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,495
Not much.
You'll just have to be patient.

352
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,415
Good day, Mr Nugent.

353
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,916
Good day.

354
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,005
You get all fixed up, sir?

355
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,965
Yes, thank you.

356
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,092
Er... Do you own one of
those dormant accounts?

357
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,010
-Well, yes. What about it?
-Oh, nothing.

358
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,679
I'm just curious
to know why anybody

359
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,306
would leave money laying in a bank
for twenty years without claiming it.

360
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,518
Well, I'm curious about that, too.

361
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,453
Did you get it?
Did they give you the money?

362
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,329
Not yet.
They want five days to investigate.

363
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,707
-Did you say five days?
-Oh, don't worry. I'll get it.

364
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,167
I gave 'em all the right answers.

365
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,377
Maybe so, but I gotta
board ya for five days.

366
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,379
Don't forget,
it goes on your bill.

367
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,550
(CASH REGISTER PINGING)

368
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,343
-Hello, Mr Sorsby.
-Mmm.

369
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,095
Quite a stack of mail this morning.

370
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,306
Bills, mostly.
First of the month.

371
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:29,162
Mr Nugent?

372
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,292
Ah. It's here.

373
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,627
A letter from the bank came.

374
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,878
Open it,
and see how much you get,

375
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,630
after I get mine.

376
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,883
How much?

377
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,014
Doesn't say.

378
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,599
They want me to
call at the bank again.

379
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,351
Probably to ask me
some more questions.

380
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,769
Oh.

381
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,030
-Oh, it's you.
-Naturally.

382
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,954
Well, this is your
observation post.

383
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,623
Yeah. And don't forget
I'm a very observant guy.

384
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,500
I'll be in on the pay-off.

385
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,389
Good morning.
I see you came back.

386
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,682
Mm-hmm.

387
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,852
Morning.

388
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,271
Oh, Mr Nugent. Come right in.

389
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,277
You didn't lose any time
getting here, did you?

390
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,113
Do you know any reason
why I should lose time?

391
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,990
No reason at all.

392
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,910
Do you wish to leave the money
in the bank, or take it out?

393
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,873
-It's okay?
-Yes.

394
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,710
The bank has decided
that the money is rightfully yours.

395
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,712
How much?

396
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,048
Twenty-nine thousand and ten dollars,
including accrued interest.

397
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,676
I presume you'll want to
open a checking account?

398
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,096
I'll, er, take it with me.

399
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,391
-Very well. I'll have a cheque raised.
-I want it in cash.

400
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,352
All right, if you insist.
I'll get the money.

401
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,688
It'll take a few moments.

402
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,441
Don't go away.

403
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,327
THE WHISTLER: What did he mean,
when he told you not to go away?

404
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,330
Will he come back with the money,
or a detective?

405
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,875
Everybody in the place
seems to be staring at you, waiting.

406
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,753
It's still not too late
to change your mind.

407
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,435
Well, Mr Nugent, I guess
this is a big day in your life.

408
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,479
Everybody in the place
is talking about it.

409
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,481
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

410
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,284
This, er...
This is our standard release.

411
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,203
Um...

412
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,831
-You seem nervous.
-Well, I am, a little.

413
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,417
Twenty-nine thousand dollars is
a lot of money for a fella that's broke.

414
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,919
Twenty-nine thousand dollars
is a lot of money, period.

415
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,130
Sign here, please.

416
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,094
THE WHISTLER: The real Lee Nugent
had no middle name.

417
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,556
Is it too late? Did Mr Simmons
see you make your first mistake?

418
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,891
-I've blotted it.
-So I see.

419
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,979
Perhaps you'd better
use another blank.

420
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,903
There you are.

421
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,364
There you are, Mr Nugent.

422
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,407
Um...

423
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,160
You'll find, er... twenty-eight
one-thousand-dollar bills

424
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,579
and the balance
in smaller denominations.

425
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,498
-Better count it.
-I trust you.

426
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,500
Oh, er...

427
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,586
Take my advice
and put most of that money

428
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,296
in a safe place
as quickly as possible.

429
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,423
I will. Thank you, Mr Simmons,
and good day.

430
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,467
-Good day.
-Thank you.

431
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,226
BANK CLERK:
Bye, Mr Nugent. And good luck.

432
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,352
-Thank you.
-WOMAN: That's our man.

433
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,354
Hold it, Mr Nugent!
We wanna picture!

434
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,779
Don't be so bashful.
Give us a big smile.

435
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:13,780
Hey! Gimme that!

436
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,615
-Come on. Gimme that camera.
-Oh, no, you don't. Beat it!

437
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,492
Okay, what's the idea
of taking my picture?

438
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,744
Because you're Lee Nugent
and you've just come into a big fortune.

439
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,412
That's news,
and I want a story.

440
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,456
I'm Pat Henley of the Daily Register.

441
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,916
How does it feel to be so rich?

442
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,211
-Well...
-Okay, so I'll print my own story.

443
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,254
"Rags to Riches."
With pictures!

444
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,381
Read all about yourself
in the afternoon edition.

445
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,010
I saw ya duck behind your hat.

446
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,595
-Were you trying to shake me?
-No, don't be silly.

447
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,931
I was trying to get rid of
that girl reporter and her photographer.

448
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,057
Oh, no kiddin'?

449
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,309
Well, why didn't you hold 'em here
until I could get in the picture?

450
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,852
After all, I'm your financial backer.

451
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,395
Hey, did you get the money?

452
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,648
-Yeah, I got it.
-How much?

453
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,316
-Considerable.
-Oh, how much?

454
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,154
There's a hundred dollars.
I guess that squares us.

455
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,489
Hundred doll...

456
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,075
Well, Lee Nugent,
you're an honest man.

457
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,535
That's why I trusted ya.

458
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,245
There was never a suspicion.

459
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,580
(CLEARING THROAT)
Er... Tonight, we'll celebrate, huh?

460
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:05,957
-Nah.
-I know just the place to go.

461
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,334
No celebration.
Our little transaction's ended.

462
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,418
This is where we split up.

463
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,963
Oh, ain't you comin' back
to get your things?

464
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,423
-What things?
-Oh, that's right. I forgot.

465
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,925
You ain't got no things.

466
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,718
Well, so long.

467
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,054
Goodbye.

468
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,017
Hey, guess I kinda ruined
your stock in trade, didn't I?

469
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,145
Oh, you couldn't help it,
Mr Nugent.

470
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,397
How'd you know my name?

471
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,024
I heard the lady calling you
Lee Nugent,

472
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,110
and so did the gentleman
that just left.

473
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,988
That's right. I guess
I'm a little bit jittery.

474
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,116
Hey, are you
scared of something?

475
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,160
What makes you think
I'm scared?

476
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,371
I've been carrying this tray
around the streets for a lot of years.

477
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,415
I study people's faces.

478
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,208
I generally know
when they're scared.

479
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,668
Well, this time you're wrong.

480
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,337
I haven't a thing in the world
to worry about. Not a thing.

481
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,299
Wonderful feeling. Say, here...

482
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,426
Here's, er...

483
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,887
ten dollars, for any of
the damage I might have done.

484
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,638
Gee, thanks, Mr Nugent.

485
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,307
-Thanks very much!
-Say, tell me, er...

486
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,142
What's the best hotel in this town?

487
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,185
Why, er...

488
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,145
The Ramsey Arms
over on Shoreham Avenue.

489
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,230
Where can a guy get
a couple of good suits?

490
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,441
You can't beat the Edward's shop
on Fifth Street.

491
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,068
I see. Thanks.
Say, w-what's your name?

492
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,654
Just plain "Smith".

493
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,531
Most people call me "Limpy",

494
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,366
on account of my game leg.

495
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,285
Well, good luck, Limpy.

496
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,245
Thanks, Mr Nugent.

497
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,670
I'll take this suit, too.

498
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,297
That's three altogether.

499
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,549
Can you make the alterations
and have them over to the hotel

500
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,842
by five o'clock this afternoon?

501
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,678
We can have one ready for you
and deliver the others tomorrow.

502
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,055
That's fine.

503
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,768
-Your name, please?
-Er... Selfridge.

504
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,853
-First name or initial?
-L.

505
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,021
"L. Selfridge."

506
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,814
-Your address?
-Ramsey Arms Hotel.

507
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,025
-"Ramsey Arms Hotel."

Where'd the fella go
who just came in here?

683
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,021
A fella? Er... Er...
What fella?

-Go? Ah...

00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,341
No violence, sir.
The gentleman just purchased

690
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,009
ten dollars' worth
of emergency exit.

691
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,053

692
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,389
Look there.

turn of events, isn't it, Lee Nugent?

697
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,895
You went to infinite pains
to prove that

698
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,314
you were the man
to whom the money belonged.

699
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,150
And now, you are hunted.

700
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,570

of the fraud you perpetrated?

710
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,769
a woman in the car
down the street, watching you.

711
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,583
LIMPY:
Look, Mr Nugent,

712
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,169
I was passing your hotel,
peddling the merchandise,

713
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,712
when I spot
a couple of hard-lookin' guys

714
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,297
askin' Pete the doorman

715
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,216
if a Mr Selfridge
had got back yet.

716
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,677
He said he hadn't.
I didn't think anything of it.

717
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,513
Then these guys moved onto
a doorway, and they started gabbin',

718
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,973
so I eased over to them,

719
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,143
and, from what I heard,
I tumbled that you were Mr Selfridge.

720
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,811
What did they say about me?

721
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,688
Well, one of them was tellin'
how you got away from him

722
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,064
at the Club Royale.

723
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,858
He said he was
gonna get ya anyway.

724
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,527
He had a... a kind of a
crazy look in his eye.

725
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,946
How'd ya happen
to head me off?

726
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,283
I started watching the traffic comin'
from the direction of the Club Royale.

727
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,952
Boy, it was a lucky thing
I spotted you in that cab.

728
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,620
Yes, it was lucky.

729
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,455
What are they after you for?

730
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,000
Is it something to do about
that money you got in the bank?

731
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,419
Tell you the truth,
I don't know.

732
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,546
Why don't you go to the cops?

733
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,965
Because there are...

734
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,466
complications.

735
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:39,968
Oh.

736
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,012
I didn't mean to get personal.

737
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,223
Haven't you got any plans?

738
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,766
Yes.

739
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,977
I'm getting outta town
for a while.

740
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,730
Do you know anything about
the trains this time of night?

741
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,940
Oh, you wouldn't stand a chance
without a reservation.

742
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,026
Your best bet is a bus.

743
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,402
There's two or three of them
leaving the terminal

744
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,237
at 8th and Main around midnight.

745
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,575
Good. You say you know
the doorman at the Ramsey Arms?

746
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,702
Sure. I stop and kid with him
almost every night.

747
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,078
Do you know him
well enough to...

748
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,164
get in my room
and get something for me?

749
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,415
I can't leave without it.

750
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,667
Well, I can get by
Pete all right, but...

751
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,628
there's a couple of
other things to consider.

752
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,214
Those two guys waiting for you
on the outside, and...

753
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,175
the night clerk and the
elevator boy on the inside.

754
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,802
I know another way, though.

755
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,512
-How?
-Through the service entrance.

756
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:25,847
Good.

757
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,767
Here's the key to room 412.

758
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,353
Now, in the ice box,
the bottom of the freezing unit,

759
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,355
you'll find a tin box.

760
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,190
You bring it to me
at the bus station.

761
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,858
I'll make it worth your time.

762
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,736
Oh, don't worry about that.
I'm only too glad to help ya.

763
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,113
I haven't forgot the ten bucks
you gave me this morning.

764
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,741
Put this thing over for me,
and there'll be fifty in it for ya.

765
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,077
-Gee. Fifty bucks?
-Mmm.

766
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,913
I haven't got much time.
It's a quarter after eleven.

767
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,374
I'll meet you on the bench
at the bus station.

768
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,417
I'll be there, Mr Nugent.

-Good.

775
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,103
Anybody see you get it?

776
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,563
I don't think so.
I didn't see anybody.

777
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,024
I brought one of your hats, too.

778
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,527
It got kinda crushed, but
I figured you might need it.

779
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,862
Swell!
You think of everything.

780
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,448
Here.
Here's your fifty.

781
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,242
I hate to take this, Mr Nugent.

782
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,868
-It wasn't worth it.
-Oh, yes, it was.

783
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,454
-Have any idea what is in this box?
-Yeah.

784
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,249
Twenty-eight thousand
in cash.

785
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,542
I couldn't help seein' it.

786
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,752
The box flew open
when I pulled it out.

787
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,422
-And you still brought it to me?
-Why not?

788
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,882
I like to think that
you're my friend.

789
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,177
You'd better be gettin'
on your bus now.

790
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,220
Say, look,

791
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,180
I bought a lot of
swell clothes yesterday.

792
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,682
They'll be delivered tomorrow.

793
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,351
My room rent's paid in advance.
I want you to have 'em.

794
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,561
You've got the key.
Go on in there tomorrow

795
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,980
-and take out everything.
-I couldn't use 'em, Mr Nugent.

796
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,189
I found out a long time ago

797
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,650
that it doesn't pay
to look prosperous in my business.

798
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,902
I'll take care of 'em for you
till you get back, though.

Money.

815
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,216
I'll let you keep it on you
till we get to headquarters.

816
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,383
Why am I being arrested?

817
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,761
I suppose you don't
have the slightest idea.

818
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,555
Or maybe you're trying to tell me
that you're not Lee Nugent.

819
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,682
I am Lee Nugent, all right.
The money's rightfully mine.

820
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,894
Who says it isn't?
I'm picking you up for murder.

821
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,312
Murder?

822
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:28,316
Maybe you've forgotten all about
the policeman you killed in Chicago.

823
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,735
-So that's why he didn't claim it.
-What's that?

824
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,820
Look, I'm not the man you want.

825
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,281
So now, you're not Lee Nugent.
A moment ago, you were.

826
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,242
Well, I'm Lee Nugent,
but I'm not the one you think I am.

827
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,826
Yeah, come on.

828
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,884
Gimme the night editor, please.

829
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,109
Hello, Roy,
this is Pat Henley.

830
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,944
I'm at the Central Bus Terminal.

831
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,445
A detective just picked up Lee Nugent

832
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,948
who collected that dormant account
this morning.

833
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,075
Yes, I'll follow through
at the police station

834
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,618
and call you from there.

835
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:55,153
Hey, this isn't police headquarters.

836
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:56,904
And you're not the police.

837
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,782
-What's this all about?
-You'll find out...

838
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,826
inside.

839
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,752
(KNOCKING)

840
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,566
Sit down.

841
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,195
I'm Eddie Donnelly.

842
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,280
Does the name
mean anything to you?

843
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,950
Then I'll refresh your memory.

844
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,786
Joe Nugent,

845
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,246
your father,
was my father's partner.

846
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,375
Your old man turned crooked,
ruined the firm,

847
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,795
then disappeared and let
my father take the rap for him.

848
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,464
Well, you're... you're all wrong.
I'm not the man you're looking for.

849
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,591
You listen.
I'll do the talking.

850
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,510
My father went to jail.

851
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,471
Your father left his family here,

852
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,931
and then went to another country,

853
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,641
where he lived on stolen money.

854
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,476
I want to show you something.

855
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,896
Bring him in.

856
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,319
I want you to understand
why I swore I'd get even.

857
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,823
Why I spent years
hunting your father.

858
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,493
I caught up with him
ten years ago, in the Argentine,

859
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,454
but I was just a week too late.

860
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,916
He died a natural death in bed.

861
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:42,677
This is my father.

862
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:45,346
Take a good look at him.

863
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,141
He's been like this a long time.

864
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,601
He doesn't know me.

865
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,103
Nor my brother.

866
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,063
He didn't even
recognise my mother

867
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,732
the day they released him.

868
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,276
Going to prison
for something he didn't do

869
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,694
snapped his mind.

870
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,779
My mother died six months later.

871
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,282
The shock of seeing him like this
killed her.

872
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,369
Now you know why you're here.

873
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,538
If you let me talk,
I'm sure I can convince you

874
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,540
that I'm not the man
you're looking for.

875
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,376
My father couldn't have been
in partnership with yours.

876
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,253
My father was never
in business with anyone.

877
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,881
His name was Dan, not Joe.

878
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,925
Furthermore,
he died twenty years ago.

879
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:26,345
I impersonated the man that
you've been looking for, because...

880
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,432
well, I wanted the money
in that dormant bank account.

881
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,684
I don't blame you
for wanting vengeance,

882
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,020
but vengeance on the wrong man
won't do you any good.

883
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,230
You're not going to let him
get away with this, Eddie.

884
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,649
You say you can
prove a lot of things,

885
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,402
but how do I know
but what you're stalling for time?

886
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,488
Why should I
be stalling for time?

887
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,783
Why do you think I went through
that window at the nightclub

888
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,994
I didn't know who you were.
I thought you were a detective.

889
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,246
I thought the bank had
sent you after me, because...

890
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,956
they had discovered my fraud.

891
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,917
Suppose I send down
to your old neighbourhood

892
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,170
and bring someone up here,
and see if they can recognise you?

893
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,255
All neighbours remember faces.

894
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:05,092
I don't mean a neighbour from where
you lived when you were a kid,

895
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,511
I mean a neighbour
from where you lived

896
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:08,221
after your old man ran away.

897
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,473
Now, what's the name
of that street?

898
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,226
Er, Read Street. 295.

899
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,769
But that won't help any.

900
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,522
Why, the building burned down
two days after they moved in.

901
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,690
So you're not
the Lee Nugent I want?

902
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,234
Yet you sit there, and tell me

903
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,153
the very number of the street
where you lived as a kid,

904
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,530
and about the fire.

905
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,241
Get up. We're going.

906
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,025
(ENGINE STARTING)

907
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,538
I suppose you're wondering
how you're gonna die.

908
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,040
Maybe you think
I'm gonna shoot ya,

909
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,001
and it'll be over
all of a sudden.

910
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,421
But it's not gonna
be like that, Nugent.

911
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,131
I've had a lot of time to think

912
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,383
what I was going to do
when I found you.

913
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,679
My father might as well have died

914
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,056
because of what
your old man did to him.

915
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,727
It would have been better
if he had.

916
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,188
But only his mind died in prison.

917
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,817
And I've arranged
to do as much for you.

918
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,945
Oh, you'll die, all right.

919
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,990
But your mind will go first.

920
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,170
(BRAKES SQUEALING)

921
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,465
You turned a block too soon.
This is Pokanoke. Back up!

922
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,806
(CRASHING)

923
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,623
(GUNSHOT)

924
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,026
Limpy.

925
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,820
Limpy Smith.

926
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,620
Why, Mr Nugent,
what's the matter?

927
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,080
They're coming for me.

928
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,665
I've been hit.
Would you help me?

929
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,209
Be better for me
if I let them get ya.

930
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,628
-Then I'd be safe.
-What do you mean?

931
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:29,714
I'm the man they're after,
only they don't know it.

932
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:31,757
They've been trying
to find me for years,

933
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,427
but they never gave a tumble
to Limpy Smith, the peddler.

934
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,845
You see...

935
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,639
I'm the Lee Nugent
you've been pretending to be.

936
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,349
The one they really want to kill.

937
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,768
-You are Lee Nugent?
-Yes.

938
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:44,979
Huh.

939
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,321
They went in here.

940
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:16,510
(THUMPING AUDIBLE)

941
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,700
Excuse me.

942
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,332
I take it the news
wasn't so hot?

943
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,625
Not so hot.

944
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,376
We just finished talking
to the people at the bank.

945
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:50,920
I told 'em I didn't
wanna prosecute you,

946
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,379
but they wouldn't
listen to me.

947
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:55,132
You'd think it was their dough
you got instead of mine.

948
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,510
Maybe when I tell the judge
how Eddie Donnelly wanted to kill me,

949
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,012
you won't have to
serve so long in prison.

950
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,723
Well, whatever I get,
I've got it coming to me.

951
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,225
Oh, here...

952
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,228
-This money's yours.
-Oh, no. My...

953
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,105
-My money's in the bank.
-What?

954
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,356
Sure.

955
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,816
You see, I wasn't gonna
be a sucker enough

956
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,317
to let you get away with it, so...

957
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,903
I took it out of the box
when you sent me for it.

958
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,114
I hope you don't mind.

959
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,490
What are you gonna do
with all that money,

960
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,908
now that you have it?

961
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,452
Well, first,
I'm gonna get my leg fixed.

962
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,996
And then,
I'm gonna start a business.

963
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,873
What'll you be doing
when I come out?

964
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,585
Oh, still writing features
and covering the nightclubs, I guess.

965
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,088
I'll give you a job
when you get out, Mr Nugent.

966
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,132
Don't forget, you spent
some of my money.

967
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,092
You can pay me back
outta your salary.

968
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,219
You might even work
into a partnership.

969
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,637
Sure!

970
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,431
We could call the firm
Nugent & Nugent.

971
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,685
What a story behind
the founding of that firm!

972
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,479
(THE WHISTLER

(WHISTLING CONTINUES)

974
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,496
THE WHISTLER:
Yes, the amazing story

975
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,749
of how fate dealt with
Lee Selfridge Nugent,

976
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,376
who learned the hard way

977
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,254
that there is no compromise
with conscience.

978
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,840
Now, he will pay
his debt to society,

979
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,842
and, after he has
paid that debt,

980
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,052
fate will be kinder to him.

981
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:26,473
I know, because
I am the Whistler.
