THE WHISTLER:
I am the Whistler,

3
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:07,066
and I know many things,
for I walk by night.

4
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,402
I know many strange tales

5
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,070
hidden in the hearts
of men and women

6
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,489
who have stepped
into the shadows.

7
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,075
Yes, I know
the nameless terrors

8
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,287
of which they dare not speak.

9
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,373
It is Edward Stillwell
who walks alone.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,293
He is a kindly,
unimportant little man,

11
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,504
the type you pass on the street
without noticing.

12
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,673
Tonight, however,
something will happen to him

13
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,550
that changes everything.

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,468
Something to make
his life important

15
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,929
and exciting and dangerous.

16
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,819
-Mr Stillwell?
-Yes, ma'am.

17
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,155
I have an appointment
to see Mr Gale.

18
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,656
Yes, I know.

19
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,617
-Mr Stillwell's here.
-DON: Send him in.

20
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,744
-Go right in.
-Thank you.

21
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,713
Mr Stillwell?

22
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,757
-Yes, sir.
-Come in, sir.

23
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,426
Come in.

24
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,762
I want to thank you

25
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,056
for staying in so late
to see me.

26
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,225
-Don't mention it. Sit down.
-Thank you.

27
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,728
Well, what can I do for you?

28
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,234
I want to know
how much it would cost

29
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,362
to have a young lady traced?

30
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,113
(CHUCKLING)

31
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,783
Well, that I can't say, offhand.

32
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,702
When did she disappear?
Who is she?

33
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,080
Her name is Elora Lund.

34
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:47,708
(OVER INTERCOM)
It's seven years now since I saw her.

35
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,877
That was when her mother died.

36
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,129
Elora was fourteen then.

37
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,632
Seven years is a long time.

38
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,093
It might cost a lot of money
to find her.

39
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,554
Are you a professional
or a businessman, Mr Stillwell?

40
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,100
I have a store
at 2319 McCall Street.

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,060
-Mmm.
-A music store.

42
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,604
Phonographs,
new and second-hand, radios...

43
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,315
-Uh-huh. Where do you live?
-I beg your pardon?

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,486
-I said, "Where do you live?"
-Er, 2319 McCall Street.

45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,279
Same address as the store?

46
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,949
Yes. I have an apartment
in the back.

47
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,452
Elora and her mother lived
somewhere in the neighbourhood, too.

48
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,331
I know that, because I'd see
Elora playing along the block

49
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,583
and see her mother
coming home from work.

50
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,003
The husband had been dead
a good many years.

51
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,296
He was a violinist.

52
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,507
You can't even give me
an address to start from?

53
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,884
Just the neighbourhood.

54
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,762
Uh-huh.

55
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,766
What was the girl like at fourteen?

56
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,019
Oh, she was just a little girl.

57
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,565
I would see lots of them
playing along the block,

58
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,068
and Elora Lund was
no different than the others,

59
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,196
except she was thin

60
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,533
and had long blonde curls

61
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,286
and big blue eyes.

62
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,708
Was she tall or short for fourteen,
or just average?

63
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,294
She was going to be tall,
I think.

64
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,213
What happened to her
after her mother died?

65
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,592
Relatives take her, was she put
into an institution, or what?

66
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,343
I don't know.

67
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,972
Well, if she's alive,
she can be found.

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,475
But it'll take money.

69
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,519
I got a hundred dollars.

70
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,146
A hundred dollars?

71
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,647
(CHUCKLING)

72
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,692
Can't you dig deeper?

73
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,111
Isn't there any way
you can raise money?

74
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,947
Maybe you're not
very interested in locating her.

75
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,409
I can mortgage my business
for a few hundred.

76
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,037
Oh, I wouldn't do that to you.

77
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,080
Why, a hundred bucks would go like that...
(SNAPPING FINGERS)

78
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,916
and we'd be no nearer to her.

79
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,544
Would it make any difference
if I tell you,

80
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,005
if you find Elora Lund,

81
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,382
she would pay you any sum?

82
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,759
Thousands.

83
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,427
Yes, tens of thousands,

84
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,929
for bringing us together.

85
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,013
What makes you think so?

86
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,848
Nothing I am at liberty
to discuss.

87
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,017
Let me tell you one thing.
The success of this office

88
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,269
depends upon the mutual trust
between my clients and myself.

89
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,062
Oh, I'm sorry...

90
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,564
I may not be the greatest
detective in the world...

91
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,776
but I am the most unusual.

92
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,278
Now, if you want to put
your confidence in me,

93
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,905
I'll find Elora.

94
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,367
All I can tell you is this.

95
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,662
If you find Elora Lund,

96
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,624
it's possible she will
make you a wealthy man.

97
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,090
Well, I suppose I'll see
what I can do with this.

98
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,343
In the meantime,
have you tried to locate her?

99
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,513
Oh, yes. I put an ad
in the newspapers.

100
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,056
-In the personal column.
-Uh-huh.

101
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,891
If anyone tries
to answer that ad,

102
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,227
I want you to get in touch with me
night or day. Will you?

103
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,854
-Oh, yes, sure.
-And I'll let you know

104
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,064
when I have anything to report.

105
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,941
Thank you.

106
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,070
And good evening.

107
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,000
-You want me to save this?
-Why, certainly.

108
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,751
Open a file for Mr Stillwell.

109
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,545
Are you really gonna
look for that girl?

110
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,715
Of course I am.
What's more, I'm gonna find her.

111
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,594
THE WHISTLER:
Three days have passed,

112
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,304
and Stillwell has had no word

113
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,265
from the private detective
he engaged.

114
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,892
He has almost given up hope

115
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,978
that he will ever find Elora Lund.

116
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:40,482
But tonight, his long search
is coming to an end.

117
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:45,798
Mr Stillwell?

118
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,598
Mr Stillwell.

119
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,566
Daddy Stillwell.

120
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,319
-Hmm?
-How are you?

121
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,738
What can I do for you?

122
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,281
Oh, it's a miracle
that I ever knew

123
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,701
you were looking for me.
I've been away.

124
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,870
But a girl I went to school with
sent me a clipping.

125
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,623
Elora?

126
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,919
Elora Lund?

127
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,798
My, how you've grown!

128
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,177
But you're just like I pictured you.

129
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,179
And you're just like
I remembered you.

130
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,849
-(CHUCKLING)
-You haven't changed a bit.

131
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,520
Oh, seven years don't make
much difference at my age.

132
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,899
Oh, but come, Elora.
Here, sit down.

133
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,069
There.

134
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,240
Now, come, tell me.

135
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,368
What have you been doing?

136
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,954
And why didn't you come
to see me?

137
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,331
I was afraid they'd put me
in an orphanage.

138
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,250
So I took what little money
there was in the house

139
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,460
and ran away.

140
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,420
I suppose you are wondering

141
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,422
why I advertised for you.

142
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,049
Well, of course I am.

143
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,092
But, even if you only wanted
to talk to me,

144
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,802
I'm glad you did.

145
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,556
I guess was too young
to appreciate everything, but...

146
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,475
I'll never forget
what a friend you were

147
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,018
to Mother and me.

148
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,145
Do you remember
those odds and ends

149
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,398
your mother used to bring to me
to sell for her?

150
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,151
I brought some myself,
when she was ill.

151
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,237
Well, I never sold them.

152
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,532
I thought, perhaps
if your mother got well,

153
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,910
she would like
to buy them back.

154
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,331
They were heirlooms.
Things she brought from Sweden.

155
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,917
Would you like me
to buy them back now?

156
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,794
Is that why
you wanted to find me?

157
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,838
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, no, no, no.

158
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,133
My dear, I wanted to tell you,

159
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,511
you are a rich young woman.

160
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,179
Among those odds and ends,

161
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,557
I found a treasure
that's worth a fortune.

162
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,019
-What is it?
-All in good time, Elora.

163
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,730
All in good time.
(CHUCKLING)

164
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,650
But I must go out
for a minute or two,

165
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,777
but you can wait right here.

166
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,158
I engaged a detective
to try and find you, my dear.

167
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,701
And I told him I'd let him know

168
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,121
the minute you answered
my advertisement.

169
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,997
I'll be back
in a minute or two.

170
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,188
(SIREN BLARING)

Er, Mr Gale?

00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,619
Yes, this is Mr Stillwell.

Oh, hello, Mr Stillwell.

174
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,831
Oh, she is?

175
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,542
And I'm sure she's Elora Lund.

Elora!

179
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,262
Oh, Mr Stillwell,
I was frightened.

180
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,055
I thought I heard somebody
in the store.

181
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,058
Oh, nobody would come
at this hour.

182
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,518
I've got something to show you

183
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,478
while we're waiting
for Mr Gale.

184
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,689
See, it's a newspaper clipping.

185
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,774
I thought of you
the minute I read it.

186
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,484
Oh, here it is.

187
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,030
Read it, Elora,
and you will understand

188
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,450
why I said
you're a rich young woman.

189
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,338

-What happened, Mr Gale?
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

193
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,949
The owner of this store,
Edward Stillwell, was murdered.

194
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,076
-Who discovered the body?
-I did.

195
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,410
What, again?

196
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,287
Now, Mr Stillwell has been
running ads in the newspapers

197
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,373
-trying to locate a Miss Elora Lund.
-Yeah?

198
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,333
Tonight, he phoned me
and said she was in the store.

199
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,418
When I got here, he was dead
and she had gone.

200
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,587
-No!
-Give us a break, will ya?

201
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,464
The most significant feature
of the whole thing

202
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,257
is that this girl
is not Elora Lund.

203
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,759
-Well, who is she?
-She's an impostor.

204
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,552
You can print that if you want,
or put it on the air.

205
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,262
-Where's the nearest phone?
-Right up at the head of the stairs

206
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,681
-Up the stairs. First landing.
-REPORTERS: Thanks, Mr Gale!

207

209
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,118

210
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,912
-Oh, Dr Gale for Miss Hanson.

213
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,228
Why, what have I done?

214
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,648
You said it would be easy.
There was no danger.

215
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,025
You put me on a swell spot.

216
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,944
I got you off that spot, too,
didn't I?

217
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,071
Oh, you did? How?

218
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,574
Open the door, Freda.
Let me in.

219
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,163
Now, Freda...

220
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,623
Look, Freda, I knew
that someone was holding you

221
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,917
because they thought
you were Elora Lund.

222
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,837
I told the reporters that you weren't,
and they broadcast it.

223
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,466
-Who killed the old man?
-I was tied up and gagged,

224
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,801
and I thought I was gonna
get the knife like Stillwell.

225
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,678
You were going to protect me,
remember?

226
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,723
Well, how was I to know that
he was gonna be murdered?

227
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,142
Did you kill him, Freda?

228
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,773
Well, unless you got
a pretty good story,

229
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,775
the police will believe
that you killed him.

230
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,111
You'll have to keep me clear
of the police.

231
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,614
-You got me into this.
-Yeah, I know I did, my dear,

232
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,450
but I wasn't present when
he was murdered, and you were.

233
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,452
I paid you a hundred bucks
to try and find out

234
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,038
why he was so anxious
to locate Elora Lund.

235
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,957
Now, Stillwell was alive
for some time after you got there.

236
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,168
-What did he talk about?
-About the girl's mother.

237
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,254
She sold him a lot of junk
she brought from the old country.

238
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,008
And, among that junk, there
was something very valuable.

239
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,885
Mm-hmm.

240
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,054
What was it?

241
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,016
-He wouldn't say.
-Oh, come on now, Freda.

242
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,518
I coached you well
for the part of Elora.

243
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,353
He was absolutely convinced
that you were on the level.

244
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,647
Maybe. But he wouldn't tell me
anything until you got there.

245
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,898
What'd you do
when he went to phone me?

246
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,691
-Nothing.
-What'd you talk about when he came back?

247
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,818
I was telling him I thought
I'd heard somebody in the store,

248
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,570
when, all of a sudden,
a door behind him opened

249
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,905
and a guy walked into the room.

250
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,740
-Had you ever seen that guy before?
-No.

251
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,950
Was he carrying anything?

252
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,910
-No...

about noise in this apartment.

Mr Summers, the manager.

You'll have to leave immediately.

258
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,973

at this time of night.

-I can explain, Mr Summers.

-You'd better go, Don.
-Now, just a minute.

263
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,988
Just a minute.
Are you sure that tough guy

264
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,365
-didn't take anything with him?
-Yes, he took me.

265
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,742
Then it was Elora Lund
that he wanted.

266
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,661
He let you go when
the broadcasts announced

267
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,038
that the girl in the store
was a phoney.

268
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,499
-Where'd he take you?
-I don't know. I was blindfolded.

269
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,001
When he stopped the car,
he untied me

270
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,460
and walked me into a building.

271
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,753
Anybody else there?

272
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,339
I didn't hear anybody.
But I heard a radio.

273
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,175
Sometime in the night,
I heard a news broadcast.

274
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,344
Get yourself fixed up.
We're going places.

275
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,013
-Where are we going?
-We'll find this tough guy,

276
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,390
-and toss him to the police.
-And we're just going to drive

277
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,684
round and round
until we run into him?

278
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,519
No, you're gonna show me
where he took you.

279
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,939
All right. Go down
and wait for me in your car.

heard of, even coming from you.

where he took me.

I know your eyes were covered,
but you still had other senses.

283

You could smell
and hear and feel.

284
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,138
Did you hear anything in that
building besides the radio?

285
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,683
-I heard a railroad engine.
-Well, that's something.

286
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,895
Did you smell any
industrial fumes around there?

287
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,190
When we got out of the car,
I smelled chocolate.

288
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,444
Well, the Milton Candy Company's
at the foot of Dow Street.

289
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,656
What was the street like,
smooth or bumpy?

290
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,450
It was bumpy, like cobbles.

291
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,370
Well, that could put us
on Macy Street,

292
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,622
behind the Milton Candy Company.

293
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,833
And what happened after that?

294
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,837
Well, we drove a little way
along an unpaved road...

did you step on cement or grass?

00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,606
It felt like gravel...

298
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,442

onto a boardwalk.

345
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,728
Did you understand?

346
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,022
I said the murderer
was Harry Pontos.

347
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,398
Well, am I supposed to know him?

348
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,817
Every dick in the country
knows him.

349
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,860
He's pulled murders,
stick-ups and burglaries.

350
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,196
A very mean man with a knife.

351
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,783
He grew up here, but he never
pulled any jobs in town.

352
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,369
Why, he probably didn't
want to embarrass his folks.

353
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,996
We found a trick knife
in his bedroom.

354
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,833
He hadn't even bothered
to wash the blood off.

355
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,884
The medical examiner says it just
fits the wound in Stillwell's back.

356
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,095
Lots of fingerprints on it, too.

357
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,389
Well, you fellas can write
"finished" to that one.

358
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,433
Yeah, but it'd look better in the record
if we had a motive.

359
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,061
Maybe we'd get a motive from
the woman in Stillwell's store.

360
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,188
Or from the fellow that
jumped out of Pontos' window.

361
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,107
There's a funny thing
about that.

362
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,651
I saw him when he was
goin' over the fence.

363
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,695
He looked just like you.

364
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,031
Same size, same build.

365
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,661
Even his feet looked about
that same size as yours.

366
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,789
How'd you happen
to suspect Pontos?

367
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,416
We got a phone tip.

368
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,043
-Any idea who gave it to us?
-A woman.

369
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,545
A woman with a cultured voice

370
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,046
who refused
to reveal her identity.

371
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,383
Yes, it usually is.
But, this time, it was a man.

372
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,052
You don't have any ideas
about that guy

373
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,304
who went through the window,
do ya?

374
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,014
Certainly not.

375
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,351
Don't bother to hide that.

376
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,061
Here's the mate to it.

377
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,023
Thanks.

378
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,275
Er...

379
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,569
Thanks for bringing it back.

380
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,778
Er...

381
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,197
(SHOES CLATTERING)

382
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,615
All right.

383
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,575
I got the same tip you did.

384
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,703
And I thought I'd follow it
through before bothering you.

385
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,331
I found that trick knife
in Pontos' pocket.

386
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,665
Before I could do
anything about it,

387
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,125
you fellas started
hammering on the doors.

388
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,377
-What else d'you find in his pockets?
-Only the stuff you found there.

389
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,047
What did you do with the diamonds
that Pontos took out of the music box?

390
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,882
-Diamonds?
-Yes, diamonds, emeralds,

391
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,467
whatever Pontos found
in the music box.

392
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,676
I don't know anything
about a music box.

393
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,596
For your private information,
there was one in Pontos' bedroom closet.

394
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,431
He was taking it apart,
apparently looking for something

395
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,849
-that was hidden there.
-How big was it?

396
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,227
Oh, about six inches in height,
seven or eight inches in diameter.

397
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,645
Not big enough to hold much cash,

398
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,647
but a lot of uncut stones
could've been hidden in it.

399
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,565
-I doubt it.
-You mean Pontos made a mistake?

400
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,691
Something like that.

401
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,485
Case doesn't wash up
that easy.

402
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,820
You trip over loose ends
wherever you turn.

403
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,989
For instance, who was the girl
in Stillwell's store

404
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,158
-and where is she?
-Ah, that is confusing, isn't it?

405
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,119
Well, you were quick enough to tell the
reporters it wasn't the real Elora Lund.

406
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,412
-How'd you know that?
-I told you.

407
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,872
I talked to Stillwell
over the phone about her.

408
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,041
Who is Elora Lund
and why did Stillwell want her?

409
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,459
If I only knew
the answer to that one!

410
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,127
We're gonna know it
before we leave here.

411
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,921
Are you implying that I know more
than I'm telling you?

412
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,298
We're also implying you'll
go over for housebreaking.

413
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,384
-Oh, you can't be serious.
-You think not?

414
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,886
Maybe you did and maybe you didn't
know about the music box,

415
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,638
but you broke into
Pontos' house.

416
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,265
That's enough to send you over.

417
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,976
-Now, who is Elora Lund?
-(CHUCKLING)

418
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,603
-Who is Elora Lund?!
-Now, Taggart, take it easy.

419
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,896
Even a murderer's got his rights.

420
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,940
Remember, we knocked
before we came in here.

421
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,775
I've told you all I know.

422
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,860
If you insist on
making yourselves ridiculous

423
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,154
by accusing me of housebreaking,
then I'm your prisoner.

424
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,906
Name the woman
who was with Stillwell,

425
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,450
and we'll forget the housebreaking
for the time being.

Hello?

428
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,332
Yes, this is Don Gale.

429
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,084
Well, come right over here.
It's important.

00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,257
-Who is she?
-Well, you took the call.

433
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,842
-Who was that woman?
-I don't know.

434
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,719
You've been teetering on
the edge of the law for years.

435

Get dressed!

THE WHISTLER: Unaware of the search
that is being made for her,

437
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,233
the real Elora Lund is recovering
from the effects of an accident

438
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,069
in the quiet of a sanitarium.

00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,874
Elora.

441
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,418
Elora!

442
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,502
Oh, yes?

443
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,212
Do you know a man
named Stillwell?

444
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,799
Why, yes, I knew him when
I was a child. What about him?

445
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,551
He was murdered last night,

446
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:49,221
and somebody using your name
was in his store at the time.

447
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,353
Nurse! Nurse.

448
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,481
She came to us a month ago
to recuperate

449
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,566
from injuries incurred
in an auto accident.

450
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,401
-BURNS: Is she able to walk?
-Yes.

451
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,736
She plans to leave
in a day or two.

452
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,197
Then she was physically able
to go to town last night?

453
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,200
But she didn't. I saw her in
the dining room between seven and eight.

454
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,118
Later, we ran a movie
in the auditorium.

455

-She was there until ten o'clock.

00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,749
-Oh, hello, Miss Lund.
-Hello.

457
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,002
Come in. Er, this is Detective Taggart
and Detective Burns.

458
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,880
-How do you do?
-Er, sit down, Miss Lund.

459
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,591
Why was Stillwell
advertising for you?

460
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,676
-Well, I don't know.
-Guy must have had some reason

461
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,095
for wanting you
to get in touch with him.

462
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,389
Do you think he wanted
to make you his heir?

463
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,350
As I remember him,
he was just a kindly old man.

464
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,019
He wasn't the type
to accumulate a lot of money.

465
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,438
Do you think the young woman
who impersonated you last night

466
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,024
could have been one of those
children you used to play with?

467
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,110
No, he would've recognised her.

468
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,028
Perhaps some adventuress
came across the ad

469
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,696
and thought she
saw an opportunity.

470
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,658
No, that kind of a person wouldn't
have fooled Stillwell for a moment.

471
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,159
She'd have had
to resemble Miss Lund

472
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,286
and answer the questions
that Stillwell would naturally ask.

473
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,497
That impostor
is the key to the whole case.

474
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,958
It must be someone
who knows a lot about you.

475
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,001
Well, I don't know who it could be.

476
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,421
I'd only be too glad to help,
if I could.

477
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,882
If you really want to co-operate
with us, Miss Lund, you can.

478
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,217
You probably read
in the newspapers

479
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,011
that we're holding the private
detective that Stillwell engaged.

480
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,096
Yes, I did.

481
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,348
Well, we think he sent
that impostor to Stillwell.

482
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,059
Stillwell would've described you
to Gale as well as he could.

483
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,603
He'd also have given him
a lot of information about you.

484
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,690
We haven't got any proof
that Gale sent the girl to Stillwell.

485
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,609
We don't want to be unfair to him.
He may be absolutely honest.

486
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,862
That's what you can find out
for us, if you will.

487
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,321
But I don't know what I can do.

488
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,074
We'd like you to come back
to town with us and see Gale.

489
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,076
Well, is it all right for me
to leave, Dr Connell?

490
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,162
-Why, yes, if you wish.
-Good.

491
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,789
We'll have Gale released. Then,
we want you to call at his office.

492
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,666
Take some identification,
and tell him you want to know

493
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,377
why Stillwell
was advertising for you.

494
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,254
I'll be ready in a minute.

495
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,056
Well, now you know what
the inside of a jail looks like.

496
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,057
We're gonna be nice to you.

497
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,185
We're gonna let you
play around in the free, fresh air.

498
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,479
But only for a few hours.
Then we're gonna bring you back in

499
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,272
and put the formal charge
against you.

500
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,733
-Unless you bring in the girl.
-What girl?

501
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,610
The one you sent up
to Stillwell.

502
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,696
If I'd sent one up, wouldn't I
be a sucker to tell ya?

503
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,990
Maybe that's where
you made your slip.

504
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,120
So long, Gale.
We'll be seeing you.

505
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,562
(BUZZING)

506
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,739
-I thought you were...
-In jail?

507
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,242
I was, but they let me out
to get you.

508
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,665
You're kidding, Don.
You didn't tell them about me.

509
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,667
And why not?
You tried to murder me last night.

510
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,671
You're crazy. I warned you
not to go in that house.

511
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,256
I told you he was dangerous.

512
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,508
You did everything
but tell me he was Pontos.

513
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,301
And then, to make doubly sure
that I'd be burned down,

514
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,719
you phoned the police.

515
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,888
I waited for you
outside in the car.

516
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,015
I was there when you ran out,
wasn't I?

517
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,475
And I drove you away.

518
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,727
You didn't wait
outside Pontos' house.

519
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,771
You drove four-tenths of a mile
to a phone

520
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,648
-and four-tenths of a mile back.
-Don, you've...

521
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,900
I looked at the speedometer.

522
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,611
Poor Freda. You never
thought you'd have to face me

523
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,196
after pulling that one.

524
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,160
Did the police say
a woman phoned?

525
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,037
No, it was a man.

526
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,747
Your boyfriend.

527
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,625
You phoned him,
and he phoned the police.

528
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,502
You're right, Don.

529
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,046
But I only did it to help you.

530
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,215
I knew he was a killer.

531
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:54,592
Y...

532
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,802
You... You must believe me.

533
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,430
I was scared
you'd get killed in there.

534
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,640
-That's why I phoned.
-Oh, no, Freda.

535
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,393
Your boyfriend phoned the police
that Pontos was in there

536
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,187
so they'd go in shooting
and burn down anyone they saw.

537
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,939
It was a neat little plot
to get rid of me.

538
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,566
You don't believe
anything I say,

539
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,860
so go ahead
and tell the police about me.

540
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,361
They won't do much to me,

541
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,113
and it will cost
you your licence.

542
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,824
It's not as simple as that.
You and I have a lot to settle first.

543
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,619
You're right.
We have something to settle.

544
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,413
You lied to me,
pitched me into a murder!

545
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,957
-Now, talk!
-You're hurting me, Don.

546
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,880
You thought there was money
waiting for Elora Lund

547
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,298
and you thought
you could put yourself over

548
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,592
as Elora long enough
to get that money.

549
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,761
But you had to find some way
to get me out of the picture.

550
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,012
No.

551
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,889
You're all wrong.

552
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,225
You're only guessing.
Why would I double-cross you?

553
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,227
There'd be no point
in having Stillwell killed

554
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,480
unless you knew
what it was all about.

555
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,815
So we can start from there.

556
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,485
And remember,
you're talking for your life.

557
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,321
All right.

558
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,325
There is money in it.

559
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,121
Two hundred thousand dollars.

560
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,582
Think of it.

561
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,252
A hundred thousand dollars each.

562
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,463
Ah, so now we're partners?

563
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,007
Why didn't you offer
to cut me in last night?

564
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,009
I figured I was entitled
to anything I could get

565
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,011
-for what I went through last night.
-What you went through?

566
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,930
All right, I'm greedy.

567
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,016
Pontos was working with me.
But what about you?

568
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,727
You're only sore because
you wanted to grab it all for yourself.

569
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,270
What was it Stillwell had
that was worth

570
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,272
two hundred thousand dollars,
and where is it?

571
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,108
(DOORBELL BUZZING)

572
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,360
The police.
They followed you here.

573
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,404
Answer it.

574
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,124
Freda?

575
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,252
Freda.

576
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,971
-She's here.
-Freda?

577
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,390
No. Elora Lund. The real one.

578
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,975
I put her in your office
because this place

579
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,644
has been like a squad room
at headquarters.

580
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,853
Good girl.

581
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,191
Now, if anyone comes in here
even smelling of the police station,

582
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,943
-give me a couple of buzzes.
-Don...

583
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,319
Hey, what's the matter with you?

584
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,821
You afraid you're not working
for a respectable firm

585
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,739
-just because I spent the night in jail?
-That's happened before.

586
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,157
-Well, then, what is it?
-It's Elora Lund.

587
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,325
She's a sweet kid
and she's been sick

588
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,701
and I'm not gonna stand by
and see her robbed.

589
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:50,953
When have I ever
robbed a client?

590
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,497
Whenever you've
had an opportunity.

591
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,294
Good afternoon, Miss Lund.

592
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,380
I'm Mr Gale.

593
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,718
Oh, please don't stand up.

594
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,012
I suppose you read
in the newspapers

595
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,640
that Mr Stillwell engaged me
to try and locate you?

596
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,685
Well, I've been in a sanitarium
recovering from an accident.

597
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,979
Oh, I'm so sorry.

598
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,940
Well, now that you're here,

599
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,025
it should be
comparatively simple to...

600
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,486
get whatever it was
Mr Stillwell wanted you to have.

601
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,071
I don't think I understand.

602
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,074
We go to the police and
prove your identity,

603
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,118
make a formal claim
for your property.

604
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,619
Oh, but I haven't any idea

605
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,330
why Mr Stillwell was
advertising for me.

606
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,457
-You haven't?
-No.

607
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:41,879
Was your family related
in any way to Jenny Lind?

608
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,630
No, not that I ever heard of.

609
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,009
I want you to think very carefully
before you answer this.

610
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,344
Did your mother
ever sell Mr Stillwell

611
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,096
any old wax records?

612
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,140
-Yes!
-What were they?

613
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,601
"Vorvisa" and "En Sommarafton".
Jenny Lind sang them.

614
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,352
What condition were they in
the last time you saw them?

615
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,937
Well, I don't know.
I never saw them,

616
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,439
but Mother told me about them.

617
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,774
They were in a little square trunk
with some old music boxes.

618
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,360
Jenny Lind died in 1887.

619
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,070
How did they come
in your mother's possession?

620
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,906
Jenny Lind made them
for my great-grandfather,

621
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,658
but he never went
into commercial production.

622
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,243
Stillwell wanted you
to have them.

623
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,661
He told me as much.

624
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:18,457
And I feel confident that the records
are somewhere in that store.

625
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,294
Well, then the police
can find them.

626
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,421
Well, you and I know
the records are rightfully yours.

627
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,964
We can't prove it.

628
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,550
And no matter how much
the police might want to help you,

629
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:32,346
they can't turn over to you
anything that they find in the store.

630
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,556
The records do really
belong to me, don't they?

631
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:35,933
Why, of course they do.

632
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,559
And I'm gonna get them for you.

633
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:41,229
And, what's more, I'm gonna turn
Stillwell's murderer over to justice.

634
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,523
Is what you're going to do legal?

635
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,401
Well, turning a murderer over
to justice is certainly legal.

636
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,613
-Won't it be dangerous?
-Well, not for you it won't.

637
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,241
Of course, I expect to be paid
for any risks that I take.

638
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:54,826
Er...

639
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,121
Shall we say
that I am to receive

640
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,958
one-fourth of whatever
the records bring?

641
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,671
-Really, Miss Lund, I...
-That's only fair.

642
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,255
Fine.

643
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,883
-Where are you stopping?
-At the Gordon Hotel.

644
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:13,178
I don't want the police to see
you until this is all over.

645
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,098
I'm going to take you
to the home of a woman I know,

646
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,599
a very nice woman,

647
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,352
and, er, you'll be
out of sight there.

648
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,895
Now, er...

649
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,063
Er...

650
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,692
Some of my clients like to
leave this way, unnoticed.

651
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:32,114
If you don't mind, I prefer
to go out the way I came in.

652
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,907
We're...
We're playing for big stakes.

653
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,118
We can't afford
to be squeamish, can we?

654
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,204
Look, if you don't have
any confidence in me,

655
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,832
maybe we better turn the
whole thing over to the police.

656
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,208
Oh, it isn't exactly that.

657
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,545
It's just that the confidence
seems to be all on one side.

658
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,755
For instance,
you haven't yet told me

659
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,634
about the girl you sent to
Mr Stillwell to impersonate me.

660
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,553
Oh, that!
(CHUCKLING)

661
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,263
Well, Stillwell wanted me
to undertake the job

662
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,223
of locating you without pay.

663
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,600
I had to find out what
it was all about, didn't I?

664
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,561
I see. What was her name?

665
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,230
Oh, just a girl that
works for me occasionally.

666
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,941
I'll tell you all about it later.
Come on.

667
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,013
Wait.

668
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,161
Miss Denning, I'd like
to have you meet Miss Lund.

669
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:05,040
I'm always pleased
to meet any friend of Don's.

670
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,126
Miss Lund is a client of mine.

671
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,837
She'd like to keep out of sight
for the rest of the day.

672
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,881
Come along.

673
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,759
Just make yourself
perfectly at home.

674
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,554
No-one will
bother you here, dearie.

675
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,934
Rose...

676
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,479
I don't want her
to use the phone,

677
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,106
and I don't want her to leave.

678
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,441
You expect me to use force

00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,864
Hello? Operator!

688
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,996
So sorry, dearie.
The phone's out of order.

689
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,586
They're supposed to fix it today.

690
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,255
It sounded all right when I dialled,
and then it went dead.

691
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,050
Sit down, dearie, sit down.
Take your weight off your feet.

692
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:43,096
I don't know anything
about telephones.

693
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,601
I never was one
for anything mechanical.

694

I don't like the nasty things.

Er... Do you have
any other lodgers?

697
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,406
Not for the moment.

698
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,242
It's easier and more profitable

699
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:07,454
to have only occasional guests,
like yourself.

700
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,082
Then, er, the others only stay

701
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,959
a couple of hours,
like I'm doing?

702
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,170
Oh, my, no!

703
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,632
They stay for days,
even weeks sometimes.

-Have a little drink?
-No, thank you.

705

Now, don't you get thinking
there's anything wrong.

709
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:44,241
I have connections with
private detectives and lawyers.

710
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:48,620
Sometimes it's witnesses
they have to keep undercover.

711
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,332
Sometimes it's clients
who want to avoid process servers.

712
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:57,003
Sometimes it's a gentleman
who's behind in his alimony.

713

Good afternoon, sir.

715
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,105
-Mr Brown?
-Yes.

716
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,899
I'm Don Gale. Mr Stillwell's friend?

717
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,027
-You knew him well, didn't you?
-Indeed, yes.

718
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,946
I was perhaps
his closest friend.

719
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,322
Well, that's what
he led me to believe,

720
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,533
and he told me that, if anything
should ever happen to him,

721
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,660
before I was able to locate Elora,

722
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,662
that I was to get in touch
with you, that you'd help me

723
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,747
-in any way that you can.
-Naturally.

724
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,374
You see, I knew Elora too.

725
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,584
Well, then you want to see
Elora get what's rightfully hers

726
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,753
and you want to see
his murderers brought to justice.

727
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:39,796
Of course.

728
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,174
You see, the police seem to be
absolutely at a loss.

729
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:46,845
In fact, I don't think anything'll
ever be done if it's left to them.

730
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,055
I know who the murderers are...

731
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,182
Er... Could we talk privately
in your office?

732
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:54,269
Oh, certainly, Mr Gale.
Right this way.

733
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,108
-Hello, Charlie.
-Her name is Freda Hanson.

734
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,568
She didn't leave
her apartment all day,

735
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,029
and the manager came up
to see if she was all right.

736
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,655
He found her body in a closet.

737
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,700
She was strangled
with a piece of strong cord.

738
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,186
-Who put the body on the couch?
-Oh, the manager.

739
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,395
When he found her
in the closet,

740
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,356
he untied this rope
from around her throat

741
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,566
and carried her in here
to revive her.

742
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,402
I figured he was
about six hours too late.

743
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,572
The medical examiner
will tell us when she died.

744

-Well, downstairs.

745

00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,844
I hope to meet him there.

849
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,971
And then you're gonna give
Elora Lund the records and...

850
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,223
and hand the murderer
to the police, is that it?

851
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,517
-That's the plot.
-I don't believe it.

852
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,894
If that were true, you'd go
to the police right now.

853
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,563
Well, have it your way.

854
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:56,107
I'm gonna get those records
and head for the border.

855
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,859
If I thought
you really meant that,

856
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,570
I'd go straight to headquarters
and tell Taggart and Burns.

857
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,488
Do what you like.

858
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:39,817
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

859
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,277
(GROANING)

860
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,072
-Can you make it up those stairs?
-Yep.

861
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,646
That's Gale's secretary.

862
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:19,398
She's going back
to tell him the coast is clear.

863
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,274
THE WHISTLER:
Look out.

864
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,192
Brown has been murdered.

865
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,486
And if the police catch you here,

866
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,447
they'll pin this one
on you, too.

867
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,079
I'm for calling it quits.

868
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,082
Perhaps you're right.

869
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,584
I've had all I want of this.

870
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,045
The cops are liable
to be here any minute.

871
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,799
Maybe it's all a pipe dream.
We've looked everyplace.

872
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,803
Well...

873
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,640
haven't we?

874
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:01,352
SUMMERS: They're worth
a hundred thousand apiece.

875
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:06,941
Lookit.

876
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,944
I can't read the rest of it,

877
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,279
but I can read "Jenny Lind".

878
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,741
And I said
it was all a pipe dream.

879
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,496
We better get out of here.
Come on!

880
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,214
Will you kindly put those
records on the floor, Mr Summers?

881
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,802
I guess it's time
for us all to be reasonable.

882
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,680
We'll declare you in, Mr Gale.

883
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,557
I'm not interested.

884
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,100
Pontos was
one of your partners,

885
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,601
and Freda the other.

886
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,062
Freda can thank you
for what she got.

887
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,732
You were going to turn her
over to the police.

888
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,775
Now I'm gonna turn you over,

889
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,736
your friend here,
and the records.

890
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,031
You're kidding.

891
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,783
You wouldn't throw
a fortune like this away.

892
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,243
Oh, but I would.

893
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,414
Somebody's gonna hang
for Freda and Stillwell.

894
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,082
If it isn't you,
I'm very much afraid

895
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,542
it might be me.

896
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:19,889
Stop!

897
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:51,754
Police headquarters.

898
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,097
This is Don Gale.

899
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,723
Get in touch
with Taggart and Burns,

900
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,809
and tell 'em
I'm at Brown's Brass Shop.

901
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,185
I've got Freda Hanson's murderer

902
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,562
and the Jenny Lind records
that caused all the trouble.

903
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,447
(MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS)

904
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,508
Too bad.

905
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,386
One of the bullets went
right through the box

906
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,929
before it hit him.

907
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,189
THE WHISTLER:
And so, after long years

908
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:55,860
of balancing precariously
on the borderline of the law,

909
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,822
Don Gale was trying at the end
to do the right thing.

910
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,159
But he made one fatal mistake.

911
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,035
Thinking that one of the killers

912
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,454
had come back to attack him,

913
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,415
he fired blindly.

914
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,710
Taggart and Burns
will never know

915
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,088
that Gale's shots
were not meant for them.

916
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:20,551
(WHISTLING HIS THEME)
