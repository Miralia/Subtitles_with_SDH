00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:25,149
(dramatic music continues)

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,086
(dramatic music continues)

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,600
(gentle music)

5
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,413
(gentle music continues)

6
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,756
(pensive orchestral music)

7
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:51,485
(pensive orchestral music continues)

8
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,045
(pensive orchestral music continues)

00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,797
(chalk clanking)

10
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,511
(hammer thudding)

11
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,015
- What's all that hammering?

12
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,350
- Jake the hangman.

13
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,392
(George laughing)

14
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,854
- Greasing up his
gallows for us, lads. (laughs)

15
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,314
- T'ain't funny, George.

16
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,193
T'ain't funny at all.

17
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,111
- There, that'll help a bit.

18
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,114
- Aye, that it does, Doctor,
though it's a little late

19
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,908
to be worrying about my neck now.

20
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,411
- You never can tell.
- Yeah, I hope you're right.

21
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,830
- [Captain] By your leave,
gentlemen, by your leave.

22
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,957
- [Prisoner] Well, if
ain't the governor himself.

23
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,292
- [Prisoner] And his Lord Chamberlain,

24
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,543
the keeper of the keys.

25
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,296
- Come to join us in a
dish of tea, no doubt.

26
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,756
(prisoner laughing)

27
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,466
- Quiet, boys, can't you see

28
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,343
he's posting a royal proclamation?

29
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,846
- You have an hour to get ready, one hour.

30
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,140
- Outta the way.
- Yes.

31
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,475
- Hark to this.
(dramatic music)

32
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,062
Having weighed the evidence
in connection with the crimes

33
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,939
upon which you have been tried,

34
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,400
convicted, and condemned to death,

35
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,362
his Majesty's Privy Council
is graciously pleased

36
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:20,074
to commute the aforesaid
sentences to transportation

37
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,244
to New, New South Wales for life,

38
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,873
Ned Inching, pickpocket,

39
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,794
the Reverend Mortimer Thynne, traitor,

40
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,089
Thomas Oakly, highwayman,

41
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,217
Hugh Tallant, highwayman.

42
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,010
- [Prisoner] How about us?

43
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,470
- [Prisoner] Some blokes has all the luck.

44
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,014
- [Prisoner] Give you a
quid for your place, Parson.

45
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,892
- Too bad there's no longer
transportation to America, Hugh.

46
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,602
Then, you'd have a free trip home.

47
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,770
- I'll take New South Wales.

48
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,356
- Where would New South Wales be?

49
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,149
- Who cares?

50
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,859
- The important thing is
we've only got another hour

51
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,694
in this filthy hole.

52
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,029
- I doubt the governor will
know when the hour's up.

53
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,197
- Why not?

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,741
- Seems he forgot his watch.

55
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,703
(Tom laughing)

56
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,462
(water sloshing)
(gentle music)

57
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,632
(boat creaking)

58
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,178
- [Prisoner] New South Wales, Botany Bay.

59
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,637
It's all one to me.

60
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,556
- Where is Botany Bay, sir?

61
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,224
- The other side of the world, young man,

62
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,977
even further than Mr. Tallant's America.

63
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,353
- [Nat] Will there be savages, sir?

64
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,065
- He said the land's full
of wild men nine feet tall.

65
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,736
- (laughs) That sounds fascinating.

66
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,404
- Is it so, Reverend, sir?

67
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,239
- I don't think they're as tall as that.

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,741
- Don't be afraid, son.

69
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,535
Nine foot tall or 29 foot,
I'll look out for you.

70
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,706
- I wonder who'll look out for me, Parson.

71
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,999
- That's easily answered.

72
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,168
At your service, ma'am.

73
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,921
- Ahoy, the shore.

74
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,342
Ground ahoy.

75
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,059
Ground ahoy.

76
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,353
- [Sailor] Seven
prisoners for the shuttle.

77
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,481
- [Sailor] Come on side. Get them on.

78
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,734
- [Sailor] Cast your grab line.

79
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:19,985
- [Sailor] Watch your instruments.

80
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,153
They're coming up for the gear.

81
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,656
- [Sailor] Yeah, boat is
fast. I call you on nines.

82
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,907
Oakly, get a move on.

83
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,408
Step lively.
- Yeah, all right.

84
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,910
- Inching.
- That's me.

85
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,620
- Thynne, Nellie Garth, Nat Garth.

86
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,164
- Be careful, Nat, boy.

87
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,083
- [Sailor] Mind ye foot there, lads,

88
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,961
Sally Munroe, Hugh Tallant, come on.

89
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,045
Get up the ladder.

90
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,840
- I'm not sure I want to risk
my life on a tub like this.

91
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,924
- Better do as you're told.

92
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,175
- What business is it of yours?

93
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,094
- Stop your jawing and get up the ladder.

94
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,470
- Suppose I don't.

95
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,806
- We got ways of taking
care of people like you.

96
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,432
Brown, put her aboard.

97
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,934
- [Sally] I'd like to see you try.

98
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,519
- Come on, my pretty.

99
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,312
Come with us.
- Let go.

100
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,480
Let go.
- Come with us.

101
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,565
(dramatic music)

102
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,108
- Let me outta here.

103
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,736
(dramatic music continues)

104
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,580
(rope creaking)

105
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,959
Get me outta this thing.

106
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,419
Get outta here.

107
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,131
(sailors laughing)

108
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,466
- Would you look what
flew up outta of the sea?

109
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,676
A blooming mermaid. (laughs)

110
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,220
- Will you get me outta this thing?

111
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,764
- With pleasure, your ladyship.

112
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,932
- Watch it now, Hurst.

113
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,684
- Did you hurt yourself, me lady?

114
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,937
- Keep your flippers off that one, matey.

115
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,188
I seen her first.

116
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,151
- Yes, he did.

117
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,320
- [Hurst] In a well spot, he did.

118
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,114
- All right.
(dramatic music)

119
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,366
Get your knife out, matey.

120
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,620
I'll slice enough salt also
off your gut to feed a ship.

121
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,164
(hand smacking)
(body thudding)

122
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,791
(item clanking)

123
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,794
(suspenseful music)

124
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,469
(chains clanging)

125
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,304
- Bo's'n.
- Aye, aye, sir.

126
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,225
(imperious music)

127
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,603
- Who has the watch?
- Mr. Spencer, sir.

128
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,980
- Where is he?

129
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,358
- Below deck, sir,
inspecting the prisoners.

130
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,567
- [Captain] What have we here?

131
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,110
- [Bo's'n] More prisoners, sir.

132
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,070
- So I see.

133
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,697
So I see.

134
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,701
And some men begging
for a touch of the cat?

135
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,870
- Ah, they was only having
a bit of a lark, sir.

136
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,246
- Put those knives away and go below.

137
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,373
- Aye, aye, sir.

138
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,582
- Mr. Spencer.

139
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,586
Mr. Spencer.
- Coming sir, coming.

140
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,256
(boat creaking)

141
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,387
- Are you or are you not the
mate of the watch, Mr. Spencer?

142
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,888
- I am, sir, but I was tween decks-

143
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,975
- I want this understood
once and for all.

144
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,352
I'm a peaceful man, and
I have a great liking

145
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,520
for a peaceful ship.

146
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,398
- [Spencer] Yes, sir.

147
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,611
- You must be the Reverend Dr. Thynne.

148
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,529
- Yes, Captain.

149
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,406
- Bo's'n.
- Sir.

150
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,199
(chains clanging)

151
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,951
- Escort this gentleman to my quarters

152
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,703
and strike off his fetters at once.

153
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,037
- Aye, sir.

154
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,289
(chains clanging)

155
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,125
- As to the other prisoners...

156
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,753
- Sir, I'd like to thank you.
- For what?

157
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,631
- Why, for saving me from those men.

158
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,716
- What is your name?

159
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,094
- Sally Munroe, my lord.

160
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,138
- Perhaps a lord someday
should a relative or two die,

161
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,141
but at the moment, Captain Paul Gilbert,

162
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,477
mate of His Majesty's Navy
and owner of this vessel.

163
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,562
Are you with this man?

164
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,482
- No, sir, I never saw
him before in my life.

165
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,486
- Have the prisoners taken below.

166
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,320
- Yes, sir.

167
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,241
- Sentry.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,410
- Take the women to their quarters first.

169
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,704
- [Sentry] All right, you
two, come along with me.

170
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,082
- Boy, you're to go with the men.

171
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:02,916
- I don't want to leave

172
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,918
my mother's side.
- Do as you're told.

173
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,004
It'll be all right, lad.
- Come along.

174
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,591
- [Captain] Mr. Spencer.

175
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,467
- Yes, sir.

176
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,928
- Those men you permitted
to brawl on deck.

177
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,430
- Yes, sir.

178
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,557
- They'll be brought before
me for punishment tomorrow.

179
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,725
- Very well.

180
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,186
- And to their names, kindly add your own.

181
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,898
(boat creaking)

182
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,941
- [Sentry] Stand by
below, female prisoners.

183
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,109
- This way, over there.

184
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,740
(Mrs. Garth screaming)

185
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,241
(foot thudding)
(mouse squeaking)

186
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,703
- Welcome to Hampton Court, ladies.

187
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,746
(prisoners laughing)

188
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,289
- Welcome yourself.

189
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,540
- [Jenkins] Come on, you.

190
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,169
(gate clanging and squeaking)

191
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,047
Get in there. Come on.

192
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,133
(prisoners laughing)

193
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,724
- Oh, stow it.
(prisoner laughing)

194
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,518
- You and your fine feathers,

195
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,478
someone'll have 'em off your
back before all night's out.

196
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,312
(prisoners laughing)

197
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,732
- I don't think so.
- Hmm, we'll see.

198
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,944
(footsteps plodding)

199
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,779
- They bring the male prisoners down yet?

200
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,155
- They're inside.
- Then let me through.

201
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,323
- Why should I do that?

202
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,367
- I have a message for
two of 'em from Nick Sabb.

203
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,119
- And who might Nick Sabb be?

204
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,995
- Well, you're new aboard, ain't ya?

205
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,040
The richest fence in London,
he was, before they caught him

206
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,669
and still rich enough to buy
a little favour now and then.

207
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,504
Am I making myself clear?

208
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,840
- You are.

209
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,135
(bolt clanging)

210
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,303
- [Prisoner] Oh, I don't who he was.

211
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,055
(prisoners chattering indistinctly)

212
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,431
(gate clattering)

213
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,600
- [Prisoner] Something besides slop.

214
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,811
- Pipe down, pipe down.

215
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,815
Which of you is Oakly and Inching?

216
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,941
- That's us.

217
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,025
- Well, get up.

218
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,652
Come this way with me.

219
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,030
(chains clanging)

220
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,574
Not you.

221
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,908
- But where are we going to sleep here?

222
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,828
- Anywhere you like, my bully boy,

223
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,414
and keep your mouth shut
unless anybody speaks to ya.

224
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,087
(hand knocking)

225
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:12,921
- [Nick] What is it?

226
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,757
- Oakly and Inching, Mr. Sabb.

227
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,885
(doorknob clattering)

228
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,013
- Well, bless me soul. (laughs)

229
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,557
I'd almost given ya up
for lost, gentlemen.

230
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,143
- Sabb, fat old lip.
(Nick laughing)

231
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,896
- All the comforts of home and taverns,

232
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,814
the finest Stinger and plenty more

233
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,900
in the barrel where this came from.

234
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,277
- Anything else, Mr. Sabb?

235
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,738
- Bring the rest of their belongings.

236
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,115
- Then we're to live here?
- Where else?

237
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,284
- How did you know we'd
be be on the Charlotte?

238
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,661
- (laughs) I arranged it with the aid

239
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,290
of a few well-placed tokens,
uh, but don't thank me.

240
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,126
I imagine there'll be openings
at Botany Bay for the firm

241
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,587
of Oakly, Inching, and Sabb.

242
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,297
- Throats cut while you wait.

243
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,299
- If you're agreed, that is.

244
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,967
- I'm for it.
- And you, Tom?

245
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,386
- Aye, if you can find room for one other.

246
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,221
- Who?

247
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,349
- My charge, Hugh Tallant.
- What's he doing aboard?

248
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,267
- The same as the rest of us.

249
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,229
- Odd, very odd indeed.

250
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,314
Fetch him, will you, Ned?

251
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,148
(chains clanging)

252
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,859
Can't be my sources of
information were wrong.

253
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,987
Bring me that strong box, Tom.

254
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,364
- Aye.

255
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,533
(chains clanging)

256
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,701
This one?
- Yes.

257
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,500
(box thudding)

258
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,960
(paper rustling)

259
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,420
(chains clanging)

260
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,505
Now.

261
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,383
Oh, here it is, the
latest London broadsheet.

262
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,388
- Hugh, this is Nick Sabb.

263
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,393
- Who's the boy?
- My name's Nat Garth, sir.

264
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,269
- He's with us.

265
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,562
- Oh.

266
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,232
His Majesty's Privy Council
yesterday reconsidered

267
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,234
the conviction of Hugh Tallant, American,

268
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,152
for armed robbery on the highway.

269
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,156
Documents newly arrived
from Maryland prove

270
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:07,119
the money stolen was part
of a 20,000-pound legacy

271
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,788
from Ezra Tallant, great
uncle of Baltimore.

272
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,834
It is reported a royal
pardon has been authorised.

273
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,044
- Your freedom and a fortune.

274
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,921
- That calls for a round in celebration.

275
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,132
- Not so fast, me laddie box.

276
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,550
The Charlotte sails at daybreak.

277
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,552
It's near midnight now.

278
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,096
The king's messenger,
even if he's on his way,

279
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,223
is snoring peacefully in some cosy inn.

280
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,311
Course, you could speak to the captain.

281
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,645
- I have to.

282
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,356
- It can be arranged
if you have the money.

283
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,608
- I have no money.

284
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,861
- That's a pity.
- Don't be a fool, Nick.

285
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,613
Didn't you just read he was a rich man?

286
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:48,118
- Lad, go tell the guard
Nick Sabb wishes to see him.

287
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,536
- Yes, Mr. Sabb.

288
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,663
(chains clanging)

289
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,582
- I imagine, since you're a
friend of Governor Philip,

290
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,083
he told you the Charlotte is destined

291
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,626
to travel in solitary splendour.

292
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,004
We'll not overhaul the
fleet short of Botany Bay.

293
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,672
- How long will the voyage take?

294
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,259
- Eight months with
luck, it's 16,000 miles.

295
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,344
(hand knocking)

296
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,303
Excuse me.

297
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,097
(glass thudding)

298
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,685
- You wanted to see me, sir?

299
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,811
- Enter please.

300
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,104
It's all right, Bo's'n.

301
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,983
- [Spencer] Captain.

302
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,817
- What is it?

303
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,819
- This man, sir, says he has to see you

304
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,238
about a matter of life and death.

305
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,199
- It's not that bad,
sir, but it is important.

306
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,242
- What's your name?
- Tallant, Hugh Tallant.

307
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,244
- Wait here. I'll attend
to you in a moment.

308
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,165
You're listed as an actress.

309
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,418
- Yes, sir, the Theatre Royal Drury Lane.

310
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,836
(pages rustling)

311
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,421
- Five years transportation,

312
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,883
theft of a necklace from
a certain gentlemen.

313
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,095
- I prefer to call it a slight argument

314
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,971
over who owned the necklace.

315
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,974
- Having heard of the
gentleman, I can understand.

316
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,560
- [Sally] Then you don't
think me a dangerous criminal?

317
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,271
- No more criminal than
this gentleman here,

318
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,774
who along with a good many
others dislikes a German king

319
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,110
on the English throne, but
you are dangerous, ma'am,

320
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,195
a veritable spark in a powder keg.

321
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,322
There are 148 men aboard the Charlotte.

322
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,574
- And some 30-odd women.

323
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,326
- Slatterns and chained below.

324
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,581
- I'm in chains, too,
or hadn't you noticed?

325
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,459
(chains clanging)

326
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,336
- If you are forward,

327
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,130
I shall keep you in
your present condition.

328
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,298
However, I was thinking of
giving you separate quarters

329
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,092
and a certain measure of freedom.

330
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,594
In return, I must ask you
to hold yourself aloof.

331
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,596
A journey as long and
tedious as this affords

332
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,265
many opportunities for mischief.

333
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,309
- I'm sure that you and the, uh,

334
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,563
Reverend Gentleman here can
keep me out of mischief.

335
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,356
Don't you think so, Parson?

336
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,566
- [Reverend] We can try.

337
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,488
- Mr. Spencer.
(keys jangling)

338
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,283
See to the lady's shackles.

339
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,284
- Yes.

340
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,829
- Now, this matter of life and death,

341
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,789
what was your crime?

342
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,583
- Armed robbery on the
King's Highway, sir.

343
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,377
- Innocent, I suppose.
- No, sir.

344
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,422
- That at least is a novelty,
the one guilty man aboard.

345
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,840
- But the one man aboard that I know

346
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,925
of who has a pardon on the way.

347
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,801
I've just learned

348
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,471
that the Privy Council
has reconsidered my case.

349
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,307
If you read this, sir,
you'll see that the money

350
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,851
I was charged with stealing was my own,

351
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,896
part of a 20,000-pound inheritance.

352
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,398
- [Captain] Imposing sum,
but how exactly does one set

353
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,192
about stealing one's own money?

354
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,568
- (laughs) Oh, for one thing

355
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,653
you need a dishonest London agent.

356
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,947
- Mm-hmm, go on.

357
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,365
- And an uncle in Maryland.

358
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,326
You see, he was sending me money

359
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,329
so I could finish my apprenticeship
at Cauldwell Hospital,

360
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,874
but the money never came, and
I had to give up my studies.

361
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,001
Then, I learned from a
bookkeeper in the agent's office

362
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,669
the money had come.

363
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,213
I accused the agent of pocketing it,

364
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,840
but, well, sir, I had no proof,

365
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,301
and the bookkeeper was afraid to speak.

366
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,469
So one night when I learned

367
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,055
that the agents went
on the Liverpool stage,

368
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,099
I, I and a friend of mine
arranged to have it stopped.

369
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,561
I only took what was mine, sir.

370
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,147
My friend was wounded,
and, well, we were caught.

371
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,982
- Most unfortunate for both of you,

372
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,610
what would you have me do about it?

373
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,486
- Could you delay sailing

374
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,488
for a few hours until the pardon arrives?

375
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,532
- My instructions are to
leave with the morning tide.

376
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,075
Should I miss it and the weather change?

377
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,243
I might be here for days.

378
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,370
The authorities will be angry,

379
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,829
and there will be the additional expense

380
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,499
of feeding some 200 souls.

381
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,168
- Maybe you could put
me ashore under guard.

382
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,002
One man more or less

383
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,296
at Botany Bay can't make much difference.

384
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,173
- You're an American, aren't you?

385
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,801
- Yes, sir.
- And a medical student.

386
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,219
You could be quite useful aboard ship

387
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,804
since we've no surgeon.

388
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,223
And as to New South Wales,
the wilds of a new country,

389
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,351
it should hold no terrors
for a man of your birthplace.

390
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,519
- I see.

391
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,813
I'm wasting your time as well as mine.

392
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,147
- Mr. Spencer, take the man below

393
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,566
and see that he stays there.

394
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,317
- Very well, sir.

395
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,987
(pensive music)

396
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:53,738
Come on.

397
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,035
(chains clanging)

398
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,787
(pipe thudding)

399
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,958
- Struggling medical
student, money from America,

400
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,209
dishonest agent,

401
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,047
armed robbery in the middle of the night,

402
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,303
it would do well for the plot of one

403
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,179
of your Drury Lane
concoctions, wouldn't it?

404
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,974
- Except there's no part in it for me.

405
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,519
- Perhaps it's just as well.

406
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,984
(chains clanging)
(pensive music continues)

407
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,452
- Brown.

408
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,581
Take this man to the tween decks

409
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,208
and see that his leg
irons are well secured.

410
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,585
- Aye, aye, sir.

411
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,421
(dramatic music)

412
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,214
(body thudding)

413
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,051
(chains clanging)

414
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,433
(water splashing)

415
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,392
- [Sailor] Man overboard.

416
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,646
- [Sailor] Have you got him?

417
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,398
- [Sailor] He went over the
side like a vanishing bird.

418
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,109
- [Spencer] Do you see anything?

419
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,070
- [Sailor] Not a sign.

420
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,324
- No, nor will there be,

421
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,536
not with him carrying the
weight of those leg irons.

422
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,373
- [Sailor] Perhaps he's lucky at that.

423
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,918
(footsteps plodding)

424
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,169
- Bo's'n.
- Aye, sir.

425
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,254
- [Spencer] Notify the
captain and be quick about it.

426
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,090
- Aye, aye, sir.

427
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,759
(pensive music)

428
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,103
(water sloshing)

429
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,905
- [Sailor] Charlotte, ahoy.

430
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,199
- [Sailor] Aye, who goes there?

431
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,160
- [Sailor] Shore boat coming alongside.

432
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,037
Stand by for me bell line.

433
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,996
- [Sailor] Aye, aye.

434
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,498
- There's someone in the water, sir.

435
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,044
- Stand by to pull him in.

436
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,548
(pensive music continues)

437
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,888
- I've got him, sir.
- Grab him.

438
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,889
Pull him in.

439
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,100
- [Sailor] In with ya, me boy.

440
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:27,976
(water splashing)

441
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,602
Come on.

442
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,770
Hold him down.

443
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,314
Pin his legs.

444
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,400
Trying to escape, are ya?

445
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:42,449
(whip snapping)
(tense music)

446
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,544
(clothes rustling)

447
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,838
- I don't want any danger of infection.

448
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,339
Have you the salt ready for his wounds?

449
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,174
- [Bo's'n] Yes, sir.

450
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,425
- Then you may proceed with the punishment

451
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,217
as soon as you're ready.

452
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,802
The sentence is 50 lashes,

453
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,804
each stroke to be counted clearly.

454
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,848
- [Bo's'n] Aye, aye, sir.

455
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,437
- I've had the cat meself, matey.

456
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,898
No matter how bad it hurts,
keep the weight on your feet,

457
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,816
and don't put the strain on your arms.

458
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:18,985
- Thanks.
- Stand by.

459
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,533
- It's regrettable that
this has to happen,

460
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,535
but this is a merchant
ship with only a file

461
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,162
of Marines to maintain order.

462
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,246
We have a long voyage ahead of us

463
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,165
and a ship filled with criminals.

464
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,333
(whip snapping)
(dramatic music)

465
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,626
- [Sailor] One.

466
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,921
- You might think these
proceedings to be unduly harsh,

467
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,923
but I assure you it is necessary.

468
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:40,882
(whip snapping)

469
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,258
- [Sailor] Two.

470
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,387
- Shipboard, as in all accepted
forms of civilised society,

471
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,264
authority has to be enforced.

472
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,516
(whip snapping)

473
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:50,350
- [Sailor] Three.

474
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,392
- Commands have to be obeyed

475
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,269
with celerity and without question.

476
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,772
(whip snapping)

477
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:56,648
- [Sailor] Four.

478
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,401
- It's an unpleasant sight.

479
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,654
Perhaps you'd be well
advised to follow her.

480
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,738
(whip snapping)

481
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,073
- [Sailor] Five.

482
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,700
(whip snapping)

483
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,535
Six.

484
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,163
(whip snapping)

485
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,039
Seven.

486
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,085
(whip snapping)

487
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:17,961
Eight.

488
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,840
- Next time, I'll have a plan.

489
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,092
- [Tom] You intend to try again?

490
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,593
- If I can get help.

491
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,095
- [Tom] You can count on me.

492
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,055
- Me too.
- But not me.

493
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,850
I'm too fond of me hide for that.

494
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,520
- There'll be 1,000
pounds waiting in London

495
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,355
for every man who helps me get free.

496
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,649
- 1,000 pounds?

497
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,573
(brooding music)

498
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,120
That's a great deal of money.

499
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,165
(bottle clanking)
(liquid sloshing)

500
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,960
(majestic music)

501
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,061
We're 800 miles off the
coast of South America.

502
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,730
Making good headway we are.

503
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,648
- I'd best be getting up
on deck now, Mr. Tallant.

504
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,734
The captain will be
wanting his dinner soon.

505
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,360
- Don't forget now. Keep your ears open.

506
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,653
We wanna know what's going on.

507
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,238
- Yes, sir.
- And your mouth shut.

508
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,573
- Yes, Mr. Sabb.

509
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,283
- We should reach Rio
by the end of the month.

510
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,326
- If the wind holds.

511
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,577
- We all ready?
- We will be, Hugh.

512
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,246
I told you the day we sight
the coast, boat in provisions.

513
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,372
- Why aren't the provisions ready now?

514
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,498
- Well, it's a delicate matter,

515
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,459
what with the guard's watching,
and tales of informers

516
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,128
among the prisoners, and the
Captain thirsting for blood.

517
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,838
We're risking our necks every minute.

518
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,797
If I hadn't-
(hand knocking)

519
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,632
- [Ned] Sir.

520
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,844
- [Nick] What now?

521
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,888
- Another knock of the
dark for the ladies.

522
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,889
(Nick laughing)

523
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,683
- They've swilled enough
rum already to float a ship.

524
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,601
- Here's a broach.

525
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,398
- Was a day I wouldn't bother
with a trifle like this,

526
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,192
but business is business.

527
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,903
(door clanking)

528
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,781
(liquid sloshing)

529
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,535
Make sure they don't
filch the muck. (laughs)

530
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,747
20 pounds I've netted, and
there's half an hogshead left.

531
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,166
- A long way from 1,000 pounds.

532
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,419
- You're right, me boy,
but don't you worry.

533
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,965
Nick Sabb's not one to
let 1,000 pounds pass.

534
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,426
Now for me weekly shave.

535
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,596
I pays high to get the water.

536
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,641
As long as I have it,
I'll share it with you.

537
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,935
We gents need to keep up appearances.

538
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,353
(hand knocking)

539
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,730
(door squeaking)

540
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,900
- Tallant, work party, report on deck.

541
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,906
Hurry up.
(chains clanging)

542
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,160
- [Sailor] Sailmaker,
raise up the foreyard.

543
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,038
- [Sailor] Aye, sir,
hands to the foreracers.

544
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,707
- [Sailor] Aye, aye.

545
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,297
- [Sailor] Cure the balsa
with the holy stone.

546
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,010
(stones rasping)

547
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:16,097
- Look at them, chained and
prodded about like animals,

548
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,725
worst possible way to reform them.

549
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,977
- Most of them look past all reformation.

550
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,228
- I disagree, young lady.

551
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,314
Most of them, in fact,
are not even criminals.

552
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,066
- Well, what are they then?

553
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,068
- Unfortunate souls fallen foul of harsh

554
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,238
and unjust laws with no more
against them than the theft

555
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,867
of a few potatoes or half
a loaf of stale bread.

556
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,618
You'll find Governor Philip agrees with me

557
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,328
when we reach Botany Bay.

558
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,164
- What do you think
will happen to me there?

559
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,750
- Well, you'll be given
a wonderful chance.

560
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,960
You'll be taught cooking, baking,

561
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,088
washing clothes, weaving, sewing.

562
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,216
You might find it a
little difficult at first.

563
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,760
- Yes, I might.

564
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,387
- Of course, if you found a husband...

565
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,472
- What then?

566
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,224
- The governor plans to
give married couples land,

567
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,851
land and the freedom to work it.

568
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,438
- That sounds a little better.

569
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,108
Now, which one shall I marry, Parson?

570
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,156
(stones rasping)

571
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,923
- The sea evidently agrees
with you, Mistress Sally.

572
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,466
You look very well.

573
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,260
- Thank you, sir.

574
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,557
(footsteps plodding)

575
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,351
- [Captain] Stand by for time sites.

576
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,813
- Parson, didn't you tell me yesterday

577
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,523
the captain had a wealthy wife?

578
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,357
- Yes, I did.

579
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,775
She's a very great heiress,

580
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,069
the Earl of Selingham's daughter.

581
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,780
- I think I have heard of
her brother, Lord Cannon.

582
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,198
- Yes, you've heard of him.

583
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,283
He's reputed to be the
worst rake in London,

584
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,911
but I don't quite understand you.

585
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,995
- You will later on.

586
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,001
Now, about the prisoners,
I think you're right.

587
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,461
In fact, I think you
should ask the captain

588
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,796
to give them more freedom.

589
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,259
We might even suggest the young
doctor be made ship surgeon.

590
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,304
- You're embarking on a
dangerous game, young lady.

591
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,223
- I've always been clever at games,

592
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,391
and you did say you were in favour

593
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,726
of reforming our fellow
prisoners, didn't you?

594
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,897
- Yes, I did.
(stones rasping)

595
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,735
(waves lapping)

596
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:42,034
Captain, I should like to speak
to you about the prisoners.

597
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,411
For one thing, it seems inhuman

598
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,621
to keep them fettered
while exercising on deck,

599
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,874
and I hear there is much sickness, so-

600
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,542
- I shall be glad to hear
what you've heard, Parson,

601
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,878
after I've established my noon position.

602
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,421
Watch the helm.
- Aye, sir.

603
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,133
- Time.

604
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,179
- Make eight bells.
- Eight bells it is, sir.

605
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,514
(bell ringing)

606
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:07,351
- I have 68 degrees, 34 minutes,
and two tenths, Mr. Green?

607
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,436
- Five tenths more, sir.

608
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,478
- Mr. Spencer?

609
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,981
- I'm two degrees off your reading, sir.

610
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,400
- Not once on this voyage
have your readings tallied

611
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,527
with mine and Mr. Green's.

612
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,653
Now, with Mr. Green's help,

613
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,406
do you think you can plot our position?

614
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,949
- Yes, sir.
- Then do so.

615
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,078
Now, Parson, I'm all attention.

616
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,247
- Well, I, I wanted to
speak to you about the-

617
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,707
- Watch out. You're too close.

618
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,292
- Aye, sir.

619
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,086
(majestic music)

620
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,178
- Open up.

621
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,096
Is the prisoner Tallant ready?

622
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,139
On deck, follow me.

623
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,684
(chains clanging)

624
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,810
- Sergeant.
- Yes.

625
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,230
- I see your arm's no better.

626
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,940
- No.
- Mind if I look at it?

627
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,233
- I told you it wouldn't be right

628
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,277
for a ship's officer to be
treated by one of the prisoners.

629
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,154
- Who's to know?
- I won't discuss it.

630
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,573
Come on.
(footsteps plodding)

631
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,409
(chains clanging)

632
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,038
- Mr. Spencer.
- Yes.

633
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,665
- May I speak to the ship's surgeon?

634
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,709
- Who would that be?
- Why, Mr. Tallant, of course.

635
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,462
I happen to know the captain's going

636
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,005
to offer you the position.

637
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,465
- But I'm no surgeon.

638
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,509
- You studied medicine, and as surgeon,

639
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,344
you're going to have freedom of the ship.

640
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,389
Of course, you'd have to give
your pledge not to escape.

641
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,724
I promised the captain you'd do that.

642
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,393
- What else did you promise him?

643
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,480
I'm to be indebted to his lady.

644
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,483
I'd like to know how deeply.

645
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,319
(dramatic music)

646
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,989
(hand smacking)

647
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,493
- You're a fool, Tallant.

648
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,037
- [Prisoner] How's it
feel with that iron still?

649
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,081
- [Prisoner] Light as a
feather, that's how I feel.

650
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,499
- Here comes the queen.

651
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,750
(prisoners laughing)

652
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,669
- And all dressed up in her Sunday best.

653
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,755
(prisoners laughing)

654
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,134
- Uh, tell me, fancy piece, too good

655
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,136
for us common folk, ain't ya?

656
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,637
- Rip off her finery, Moll.

657
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,430
- Leave her alone, Moll.

658
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,597
She's doing you no harm.

659
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,599
- Mind your own business, ya fat sow.

660
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,434
(fist thudding)

661
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,393
- Fat sow, ya slag.

662
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:17,398
(dramatic music)
(prisoners screaming)

663
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,318
(water splashing)

664
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,405
(prisoners yelling indistinctly)

665
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,199
(body thudding)

666
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,326
(prisoners yelling indistinctly)

667
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,493
- [Sailor] Hey there, stop it.

668
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,370
Do you hear me? Stop it.

669
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,582
(water splashing)

670
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,417
- Hey, stop it. Do you hear me?

671
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,251
Stop it.

672
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,423
- Try to, try to kick him.

673
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,217
(dramatic music continues)

674
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,053
- [Sailor] Stop those wenches fighting.

675
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,180
They're outta hand there.

676
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,686
(prisoners yelling indistinctly)

677
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,438
(water splashing)

678
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,440
(gunshot blasting)

679
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,735
(prisoners whimpering)

680
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,238
(footsteps plodding)

681
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,323
- Reload, sentry.

682
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,494
If there's any further disturbance,

683
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,246
I shall order the deck
swept with musket fire.

684
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,832
Remove the net, onto
your feet, all of you.

685
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,921
Against my better
judgement, I was persuaded

686
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,840
by Dr. Thynne to exercise
a certain clemency.

687
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,759
I ordered you relieved of your fetters

688
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,428
and allowed you privileges on
deck, and now this exhibition.

689
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,930
What have you to say for yourselves?

690
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,432
- Well, you see it was like this, Captain.

691
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,810
We was dancing a-
- Silence.

692
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,146
Insurrection and impertinence,

693
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,399
what have you to suggest now, Parson?

694
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,110
You shall have 20 lashes.

695
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,154
As for the others, Mr. Green,
restore their leg irons,

696
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,365
and by way of an example,
select three of them

697
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,658
to have their heads shaved.

698
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,659
- Aye, aye, sir.

699
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,994
- Guard, escort Mistress
Munroe to my cabin.

700
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,998
(waves lapping)

701
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,422
(prisoner whimpering)

702
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,341
(clothes rustling)

703
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,596
(prisoner screaming)

704
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,848
(shears rasping)

705
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,894
(whip snapping)
(prisoner screaming)

706
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,897
Mr. Spencer.
- All right,

707
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,190
get fired, all of ya.

708
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,651
- For failure to preserve order,

709
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,902
you are again admonished,

710
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,447
the fact again to be entered in the log.

711
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,740
- I did what I could,
sir, but with this arm.

712
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,243
- Is it my fault that, in
addition to being incompetent,

713
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,161
you are a cripple?

714
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,330
Well, sir, will you answer me?

715
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,624
- It is not your fault, sir.

716
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,343
- You change your mind
about your arm, Mr. Spencer,

717
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,470
just give me the word.

718
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:01,729
(footsteps plodding)
(boat creaking)

719
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,231
- Wait outside.

720
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,109
(door clattering)

721
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,946
(pensive music)

722
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,159
The women seem to have taken
a dislike to you, my dear.

723
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,620
I trust you're unharmed.

724
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,330
- More or less.

725
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,167
- I see on your shoulder a scratch.

726
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,171
Perhaps we should send
for the new surgeon.

727
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,964
- He refused the position.

728
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,175
- You talked with him?
- Only a few words.

729
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,720
- Pity on a skin so smooth.

730
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,056
- And ruined the only decent dress I have.

731
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,600
- There's thread and
needle in the ship's store,

732
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,144
and I'm sure material of
some kind can be found.

733
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,898
- Don't I owe you too much already?

734
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:50,444
- Yes, and I think it's
time we talked of payment.

735
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,405
You're not gonna be alarmed, are you?

736
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,115
Violence is foreign to my nature,

737
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,660
but you have enjoyed a
favourite position onboard ship,

738
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,996
private cabin, special
privileges, special food.

739
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,706
Either these pleasant conditions continue,

740
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,167
or you return below with the other women,

741
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,669
and I hesitate to think what'll happen

742
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,003
to you, feeling as they do.

743
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,131
- You leave me little choice.

744
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,096
- You're very wise and very lovely,

745
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,227
and I think you'll find
me not unappreciative.

746
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,565
- I'm sure, but in a way, this is a pity.

747
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,857
- How?

748
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,193
- I shall have to destroy
those letters I intended

749
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,238
to send from Rio and write
others in their place.

750
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,489
- Letters to whom?

751
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,578
(footsteps plodding)

752
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,747
- Lord Cannon.
- Selingham's son?

753
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,457
- I thought I'd told you.

754
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,626
Jack and I were friends in London.

755
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,461
- He has the reputation of a rake.

756
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,047
- I found him quite constant.

757
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,383
I'd written such glowing accounts

758
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,468
of your kindness and chivalry.

759
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,428
- Why change them?

760
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,763
- Jack made me promise to tell him

761
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,974
exactly what went on aboard the Charlotte.

762
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:07,062
I suppose it was because of
his sister, your wife, Helen.

763
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,565
(dramatic music)

764
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:13,360
(footsteps plodding)

765
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,322
Now, with your permission,
sir, I'll leave.

766
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,326
(door clattering)

767
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,584
(pensive music)

768
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,968
- Escape's getting closer every day.

769
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,472
Look what Tom lifted for the longboat,

770
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,266
ship's lantern, rope for rigging sails,

771
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,519
canvas, and a file to
cut off your shackles.

772
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,438
- It's good for a start.

773
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,815
But how do we get the
longboat over the side?

774
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,400
- I'll think of a way

775
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,444
if I have to sink the Charlotte to do it.

776
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,238
(hand knocking)

777
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,073
All right, Tom.

778
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,911
(chains clanging)

779
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,998
(hand knocking)

780
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,750
- That you, Ned?
- Aye.

781
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:13,045
(door clattering)

782
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,881
Gents, look at what Ned Inching run onto.

783
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,592
- What is it?

784
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,553
- Token of esteem from the
tenants of the Earl of Selingham

785
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,013
to Captain Paul Gilbert on the occasion

786
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,765
of his marriage to Lady Helen Cannon.

787
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,809
(lid clanking)

788
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,062
- His boat compass.
- Fancy made and fancy mounted

789
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,772
and a mighty handy thing for Hugh to have.

790
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,357
- Handy?

791
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,150
Handy enough to get us all
hanged from the yard arm.

792
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,027
- But I thought-
- Who told you to get it?

793
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,362
- Well, nobody.

794
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,489
- You take it back.
- How can I?

795
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,699
Might be days before I got

796
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,117
a sure chance again.
(hand knocking)

797
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,159
- [Jenkins] Mr. Sabb.

798
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,162
(boat creaking)

799
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,791
(doorknob clattering)

800
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:51,750
- What do you want?

801
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,544
- The mate wants Tallant in his cabin.

802
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,420
- Be right there.

803
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,090
Find a chance to get it back in quick.

804
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,341
You understand?

805
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,759
- [Ned] Yes, Hugh.

806
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,302
(chains clanging)

807
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,012
(door clattering)

808
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,181
It'll be 50 lashes at least if I'm caught.

809
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,725
- Worse, if I know the captain.

810
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,934
- Let me take it, Ned.

811
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,686
I'm in and out of his cabin day and night.

812
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,812
Would be easy for me.

813
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,356
- Give us your hand, boy.

814
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,525
You're a perishing genius. That's what.

815
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,237
- There's no doubt about it, Mr. Spencer.

816
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,989
The arm has been set improperly.

817
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,990
- You sure you can remedy it?

818
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,658
- Yes, but I'll have to re-break it,

819
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,160
and, well, it'll hurt.

820
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,536
- I'd put it in fire if I thought

821
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,371
it would make it right again.

822
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,539
- Then I'm to go ahead?

823
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,542
- Whenever you're ready.

824
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:37,629
There's just one thing that
bothers me, though, the fee.

825
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,841
I have a little money in my
sea chest but not very much.

826
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,260
- I wasn't thinking of money, Mr. Spencer.

827
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,179
When we provision at Rio,

828
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,222
the supply barges come
alongside, don't they?

829
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,017
- No, Tallant, I have no
cause to like this ship

830
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,103
or its master, but I know my duty.

831
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,898
- All you have to do is turn your back
for a minute, Mr. Spencer.

832
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,861
I think it's a small fee for a mended arm.

833
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,362
- It's a fee I'll not pay.

834
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,158
- All right, we'll forget the fee.

835
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,619
- I don't know that I like any of this.

836
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,662
By rights, I should inform
the captain immediately.

837
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:15,417
(fist thudding)
(dramatic music)

838
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,086
(pensive music)

839
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:30,349
(ropes creaking)

840
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,358
- [Sailor] Light it along current.

841
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,568
Light along current for the sail locker.

842
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,445
- [Sailor] Get a move on,

843
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,948
or you'll get a taste of a rope's end.

844
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:46,990
Bear a hand.

845
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,076
Get that sail along to the sail locker.

846
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,747
- [Nat] Let me go, sir.

847
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,082
I wasn't doing anything.

848
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,167
- [Mr. Green] Not much you weren't.

849
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,168
- What is it, Mr. Green?

850
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,294
- I caught him outside your cabin

851
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,838
with your boat compass, sir.

852
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,464
Lucky I happened to be passing by.

853
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,590
- Very lucky.

854
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,717
What have you to say for yourself?

855
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,552
- Nothing, sir.

856
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,556
- You did intend to steal my compass?

857
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,183
Speak up.

858
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,936
- [Nat] Yes, sir, I did.

859
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,980
- The sentence for theft
is 100 lashes well applied

860
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,690
and solitary confinement
on bread and water

861
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,900
until such time as I
see fit to release you.

862
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,029
However, in view of your age,

863
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,282
I will suspend the flogging.

864
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,157
Take him below.

865
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,702
And Mr. Green, return that to my cabin.

866
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,745
- [Mr. Green] Aye, aye, sir.

867
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,998
(pensive music continues)

868
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,084
(footsteps plodding)

869
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,259
- Couldn't I speak to
my mother first, sir?

870
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,385
- I'm afraid not, son.

871
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,273
(coins clanking)

872
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,284
- Present from Nick Sabb.

873
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,368
- What's it for?

874
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,663
- Little talk with the boy.

875
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,710
- But you make it short.

876
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,922
I'm only relieving Sim while
he goes to get the food.

877
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,173
Over to you.

878
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:30,886
(boat creaking)
(keys jangling)

879
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:31,970
- [Hugh] Nat.

880
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,308
- Mr. Tallant.

881
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,352
- That was a very brave
thing you did today.

882
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,562
- I couldn't very well
tell on Mr. Inching.

883
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,731
- I know, Ned, not and be a man.

884
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,984
We'll see you don't suffer
for too much, though.

885
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,070
- I'm all right, but it's
awful dark down here.

886
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,823
(door clattering and creaking)

887
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,284
(footsteps plodding)

888
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,244
- Yeah, what's going on?

889
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:00,749
- Business, business
that we've been paid for.

890
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,750
Come on.

891
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,627
We'll feed Connors his ration.

892
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,633
Tallant, I'll give you one minute more.

893
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,680
- Will you tell my mother you saw me?

894
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,431
- [Hugh] I'll do that right away, Nat.

895
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,100
- [Jenkins] Blast me guts.

896
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,854
Gone and died on us.

897
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,858
- He's stiff as a bowling pin.

898
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,236
- [Jenkins] That ain't
natural, not so quick.

899
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,363
- No, it ain't.

900
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,700
Did you see his skin?

901
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,368
He's all covered with black spots.

902
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,078
- Plague, that's what it is.
(brooding music)

903
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,789
And you touched him,
plague, plague, plague.

904
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,878
- [Sailor] We want the
captain, and we want him quick.

905
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,090
- [Sailor] Let us pass,
or we take to the boats.

906
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,134
- [Sailor] No cause to die like this.

907
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:55,929
- Be all very well free to
shout silence, Mr. Spencer.

908
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,809
We going up whether he like it or not.

909
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:01,768
(dramatic music)

910
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,520
- Back, or there'll be violence.

911
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,396
- Hold it.

912
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,773
- [Sailor] The surgeon.

913
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,317
- You'll all get yourself in
trouble for no cause at all.

914
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,402
- Plague no cause?

915
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,070
- Not the plague, it's scurvy.

916
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,196
I'll give you my word.

917
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,281
- [Sailor] Scurvy?

918
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,615
- You know what scurvy is.

919
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,202
I examined him, and there's
not a trace of plague.

920
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,205
All he needed was a decent meal.

921
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,333
Better go below before
the captain sees ya.

922
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,716
- After this, you keep your mouth shut.

923
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,051
(hand thudding)
(dramatic music)

924
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,762
- [Spencer] Come on all of
you, back to your quarters.

925
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,478
- I wonder what Captain
Gilbert would've thought

926
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,730
if they'd gone pouring into his cabin.

927
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,815
- They would never have reached my cabin,

928
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,569
at least not alive.

929
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,029
Come here, both of you.

930
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:57,491
(chains clanging)

931
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,867
Mr. Spencer, it is now quite obvious

932
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,995
you are a hopelessly incompetent officer.

933
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,121
I will enter that in the log

934
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,998
as well as the fact you
are permanently relieved

935
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,750
as second mate on this date.

936
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,127
Stand still while I'm talking to you.

937
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,922
The bo's'n will take
over your former duties.

938
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,132
Move your gear forward
to the folks at once.

939
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,177
You may resume your duties.

940
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,187
How is it, Tallant, you were
so sure it wasn't plague?

941
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,816
- My father and mother died
of the plague in Baltimore.

942
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,691
- Hmm.

943
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,069
For leaving your quarters
without permission,

944
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,070
I should punish you.

945
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,198
But that might be ungrateful.

946
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,160
I shall content myself

947
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,831
with cautioning you against
such liberties in the future.

948
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,583
(dramatic music)

949
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,547
(chains clanging)

950
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,884
- Mr. Tallant.

951
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,639
May I ask you something?

952
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,436
Why did you refuse to be ship surgeon

953
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,897
when you're doing all the work anyway?

954
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,900
Was it because you'd have to
give your word not to escape?

955
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,485
- Would you?

956
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,321
- Yes, if it meant I'd do
better here and at Botany Bay.

957
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,199
- I don't want any favours from anywhere.

958
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,076
- What do you want?

959
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,747
- I wanna do what I set
out to do, be a doctor.

960
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,333
- Tell me the real reason,
or don't you even know it?

961
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,171
- Maybe I don't like leg irons.

962
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,715
- It's time you decided
to make the best of them.

963
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:37,549
- [Hugh] Why?

964
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,135
- Because the odds
against escape are 1,000

965
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,344
to, a million to one.

966
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,513
Even if you do get away,

967
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,224
you'll probably have to
run the rest of your life.

968
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,559
- I'd rather be a free man running

969
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,811
than the most comfortable
slave in the world.

970
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,024
- The world's taught me we're
all slaves one way or another.

971
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,151
That's life, Mr. Tallant.

972
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,403
You might as well accept life.

973
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,947
- Like you did with the captain.

974
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,659
- At least I wasn't nearly
drowned, and flogged,

975
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,036
and put to scrubbing decks.

976
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,247
- Supposing you attend to your business,

977
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:13,376
and I'll attend to mine.
(dramatic music)

978
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,256
(chains clanging)

979
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,967
(pensive music)

980
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:30,685
(Nick laughing)

981
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,771
- So you'll slip over the side at Rio.

982
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,315
Sounds simple, like
stepping into the next room

983
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,067
till you remember there's
guards to be greased,

984
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,527
locks to be picked, boltmen to be hired.

985
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,904
My way of thinking, you'd have done better

986
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,781
to stick with my scheme.

987
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,241
- I might have, Nick,

988
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,701
if you'd have found out
how to launch the boat.

989
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,703
Think the new plan's safer, though,

990
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,664
and you get your thousand
pounds regardless.

991
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,540
- Sure you can trust the outside man?

992
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,210
- Who said there was an outside man?

993
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,419
- There has to be.

994
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,213
- I can trust him.

995
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,714
- Maybe you'd like my opinion.

996
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,261
- I promise I'd tell
nobody's name, not even Tom.

997
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,720
- Must be someone important.

998
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,888
(hand knocking)

999
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,724
(chains clanging)

1000
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,519
(door clattering)

1001
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,062
- Knock it. The mate's coming.

1002
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,188
- Yeah, it's the glib.

1003
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,191
(suspenseful music)

1004
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,447
(door squeaking)

1005
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,323
- Tallant.

1006
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:27,200
- Yes.

1007
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,327
- You're to come with
us, Captain's orders.

1008
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,582
(chains clanging)

1009
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,881
(pensive music)

1010
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:54,936
- It's a pleasant evening.

1011
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,605
(hand knocking)

1012
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,527
Oh, it's you, Tallant.

1013
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,279
Come here and stand beside Spencer.

1014
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,116
Mr. Green, you can wait outside.

1015
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,618
- [Mr. Green] Aye, aye, sir.

1016
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,455
(waves lapping)

1017
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,248
- I don't want to keep you
from your dinner, Parson.

1018
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,666
Perhaps you'd like to say grace.

1019
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,627
- I've already said my
devotions privately.

1020
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:23,381
- Very well, I'll say grace
for myself and Mistress Munroe.

1021
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,258
Oh, God, give us
thankfulness, and humility,

1022
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,010
and thankfulness for
your bounty and humility

1023
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,553
before our fellow man.

1024
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,222
(lid clanking)

1025
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,682
(glass thudding)

1026
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:37,687
(boat creaking)
(waves lapping)

1027
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,695
Tompkins, you may serve the soup.

1028
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,531
(bottle clanking)

1029
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,533
This is a matter of discipline.

1030
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,826
It'll only take a moment.

1031
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,537
Before I pass sentence on you, Tallant,

1032
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,747
justice requires me to ask

1033
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:58,208
if you have anything to say for yourself.

1034
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,292
- About what?

1035
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:02,128
- [Captain] You're charged
with plotting an escape with Spencer.

1036
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,255
Do you admit the charge?

1037
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,090
- No, sir.

1038
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,844
- Do you recognise these keys?
(keys jangling)

1039
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,471
- Ship's keys I suppose.

1040
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,681
- And the master key to
the prisoners' shackles.

1041
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,768
- I told you I meant to use
them for my own purposes.

1042
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,478
- They were found on Spencer,

1043
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,438
who I believe is deeply indebted to you

1044
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,440
for having repaired his arm.

1045
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,983
I have a witness who saw you treating him

1046
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,318
not more than an hour ago.

1047
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,862
- I see no witnesses.

1048
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,072
- Be quiet, sir.
(hand thudding)

1049
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:32,867
You've not only done yourself a disservice
but also your fellow convicts.

1050
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,078
Since it is possible there
are others in your plot,

1051
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,997
I shall not put in it Rio
but proceed to Cape Town

1052
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,167
where the authorities will
provide me with extra guards.

1053
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,878
This will mean shorter
rations for the entire ship.

1054
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,297
As for the witness, I shall
produce him when you're brought

1055
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,258
before Governor Philip at Botany Bay.

1056
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,637
In the meantime, you'll both
be held in solitary confinement

1057
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,889
for the remainder of the voyage.

1058
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,684
(dramatic music)

1059
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,984
(thunder clapping)
(waves roaring)

1060
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,288
(water splashing)

1061
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,581
- [Sailor] We're taking water below.

1062
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,541
We're taking in water.

1063
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,084
(water splashing)

1064
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:28,131
(Nat whimpering)
(boat creaking)

1065
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,340
- Oh, Mother.

1066
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,471
Oh, Mother, Mother.

1067
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,808
- Nat.
- Mother.

1068
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,895
I want my mother.

1069
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:44,898
I'm so cold. (sobbing)

1070
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,691
- Keep out of the water
as much as you can, Nat.

1071
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,193
- I cold, so cold.

1072
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,655
- Think there's any chance
of our escaping earlier?

1073
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,532
- You know better than that, Hugh.

1074
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,743
It'll be at least a week
before we're close enough

1075
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,329
to the coast of Africa to
have any chance at all.

1076
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,623
(Nat sobbing)

1077
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,541
(thunder clapping)

1078
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,960
- Mother. (sobbing)

1079
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,295
- We gotta get him outta here.

1080
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,048
- Perhaps his mother could
reason with the captain.

1081
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:14,761
- Better still, somebody get
word to the captain's lady.

1082
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,680
(thunder clapping)

1083
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:24,187
(water splashing)
(dramatic music)

1084
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,736
(sailors yelling indistinctly)

1085
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,865
- [Mrs. Garth] If you have
one drop compassion left

1086
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,117
in your blood, Captain,
you'll do what I ask.

1087
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,410
- If you persist in badgering me,

1088
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,995
I shall have you in chains.

1089
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,081
- But he's only a child.

1090
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,416
- Get below, both of you.

1091
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,210
Get below, I said.

1092
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,255
(wind howling)
(dramatic music continues)

1093
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:55,301
(thunder clapping)
(water splashing)

1094
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,513
(wind howling)

1095
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:05,687
(boat creaking)
(water sloshing)

1096
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:08,940
- Nat, Nat, Spencer.

1097
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,655
- [Spencer] Yes.

1098
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:16,990
- Can you see him, Spencer?

1099
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,742
- No.

1100
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:22,996
- Jenkins, Jenkins.

1101
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:30,169
- Pipe down, pipe down.
(keys jangling)

1102
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,006
What is it?

1103
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,882
- Take a look at the boy.

1104
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,097
- Seems to be asleep.

1105
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,684
- Put something under him.
- What me?

1106
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:45,977
If I was as much as to touch him,

1107
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,187
the captain would've
me hung up by my heels.

1108
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,151
(boat creaking)

1109
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,987
Now, this is strange.

1110
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,657
Who gave you permission to come down here?

1111
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,744
- What do you care, long
as Nick Sabb's paying ya?

1112
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,786
Give me your keys.

1113
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,248
- He's not paying me to hand
over no keys, not to nobody.

1114
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,042
(hand thudding)
(Jenkins groans)

1115
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,961
(water sloshing)

1116
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,089
- [Mrs. Garth] Nat, Nat, Nat.

1117
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,508
- Bring him outside, Tom,
where I can take a look at him.

1118
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,261
(metal clanging)

1119
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:23,431
- Nat.

1120
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,937
(melancholic music)
(chains clanging)

1121
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:30,772
Nat.

1122
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,778
Nat.

1123
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,404
What have they done to you, Nat?

1124
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,619
My boy, it's your mother.

1125
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,537
Speak to your mother.

1126
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,748
(water sloshing)

1127
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,542
- Afraid he can't, Mrs. Garth.

1128
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,753
(boat creaking)
(water sloshing)

1129
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:54,629
- No.

1130
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:58,216
No.

1131
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,303
Nat, Nat.

1132
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:11,562
My son, my only son. (sobbing)

1133
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:19,529
(boat creaking)
(water sloshing)

1134
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:34,293
(bell ringing)

1135
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,092
(body thudding)

1136
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:43,428
- Gangway, gangway there, gangway.

1137
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,394
- Uncover.

1138
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,189
"I am the resurrection and
the life," said the Lord.

1139
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,066
"He that believeth in
me, though he were dead,

1140
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,736
yet shall he live, and whosoever liveth

1141
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,488
and believeth in me shall never die."

1142
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:05,116
I know that my redeemer
liveth and that he shall stand

1143
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,326
at the latter day upon the earth,

1144
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,787
and thereafter my skin,
worms destroy this body,

1145
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,749
yet in my flesh shall I see God,

1146
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,916
whom I shall see for myself,

1147
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,878
and mine eyes shall behold not another.

1148
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,755
Thou knoweth, Lord, the
secrets of our hearts.

1149
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,715
Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers,

1150
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,342
but spare us, Lord most
holy, oh, God most mighty,

1151
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,886
oh, holy and merciful saviour,

1152
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,847
our most worthy judge
eternal, suffer us not

1153
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,017
at our last hour for any pains
of death to fall from thee.

1154
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,606
And to almighty God we commend

1155
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,691
the soul of Nat Garth departed

1156
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,151
and commit his body to the deep.

1157
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:42,111
(Mrs. Garth sobbing)

1158
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,196
(body rasping)

1159
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,032
(water splashing)

1160
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,700
Assurance that and hope
of the resurrection

1161
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,660
unto eternal life through
our Lord Jesus Christ

1162
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,662
who's coming in glorious
majesty to judge the world.

1163
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,955
The sea shall give up her dead,

1164
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,123
and the corruptible bodies of those

1165
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,500
who sleep in him shall be changed

1166
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,460
and made like unto his glorious body

1167
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,253
according to the mighty
working whereby he's able

1168
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,172
to subdue all things unto himself.

1169
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,965
Dismissed, gangway.
- Aye, sir.

1170
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,968
- [Sailor] Gangway there,
gangway for the captain.

1171
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,345
- [Sailor] Prisoners below.

1172
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,305
- Mr. Green, the mizz

1173
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,225
and the gallant are not braced properly.

1174
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:15,061
(chains clanging)

1175
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,273
(brooding music)

1176
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:23,069
(door creaking and slamming)

1177
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,576
(paper rustling)

1178
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,706
(candle holder thudding)

1179
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,464
(brooding music continues)

1180
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,816
(knife rasping)

1181
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,276
(dramatic music)

1182
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,695
Mr. Green.
(revolver clattering)

1183
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,656
(gunshot blasting)

1184
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,868
- Are you hurt, sir?

1185
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,077
- Leave me be.

1186
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,788
Get her on her feet.

1187
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,092
If nothing else, I shall have the pleasure

1188
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:30,011
of seeing you hanged tomorrow morning.

1189
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,013
Take her away.

1190
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,892
Get my medicine box.

1191
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:41,689
(pensive music)

1192
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,455
(boat creaking)

1193
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,540
- This is an awful sudden decision, Hugh.

1194
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,379
- Would you have Mrs.
Garth hanged at the atoll?

1195
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,007
- No, but I've had no
chance to bribe anyone,

1196
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:09,300
save the guards below deck.

1197
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:10,885
- We'll handle the rest.

1198
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:11,928
- Where is Mrs. Garth?

1199
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,262
- She should be here now.

1200
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:14,972
Inching's fetching her.

1201
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,891
- How about the men?
- They're rigging the tackles.

1202
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,351
- The boat?
- Water breaker grub

1203
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,226
ready to go.

1204
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,062
(door squeaking)

1205
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,272
- Here they are now.
- You ready, Mrs. Garth?

1206
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,398
- Just a minute please.

1207
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,818
- What's the matter?
- She claims nothing.

1208
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,236
- I'm all right, just...

1209
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:34,408
(dramatic music)

1210
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,534
- Blood, she's been wounded.

1211
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,161
- Bad?

1212
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,579
- No, it's just a flesh wound.

1213
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,414
Rest and care, she'll feel fine.

1214
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,667
- She'll not get either in an open boat.

1215
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,211
- No, she won't.
- But we can't leave her here.

1216
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,671
- Perhaps we can.

1217
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:48,965
Nick, where were you
hiding those big barrels

1218
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,091
of rum you were selling?

1219
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,635
- Forward of the cable
tier, it's all gone.

1220
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:53,469
- I know that.

1221
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,512
How big a place was it?

1222
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,348
- Big enough for two of her.

1223
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,265
- That's no good.

1224
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,767
They'll search till they find her.

1225
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,643
- No, they won't.

1226
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,729
They'll think she went with us.

1227
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,398
Nick can hide her until
they get to Botany Bay

1228
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,108
and then put her to shore.

1229
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,568
I understand Governor
Phillip is a very fair man.

1230
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,279
It's our only chance, Tom.

1231
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,659
- And I'll be staying,
too, and look after her.

1232
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,578
- Good luck.

1233
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,292
(gentle music)

1234
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,923
(suspenseful music)

1235
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,096
(footsteps plodding)

1236
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,399
- Mr. Green, smoke coming
from the fore peak.

1237
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,443
(footsteps plodding)

1238
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,320
- You men, below to the fore peak.

1239
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,823
- What's the matter?
- Hey, what's this?

1240
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,158
- Where's everybody going?
- Yeah, where?

1241
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:00,036
(prisoners chattering indistinctly)

1242
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:03,873
(suspenseful music continues)

1243
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:24,143
(suspenseful music continues)

1244
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,353
- [Prisoner] There must
be something up, eh?

1245
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,355
(footsteps plodding)

1246
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,950
(door clattering)

1247
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,333
(club thudding)

1248
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:50,002
(body thudding)

1249
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,509
- [Sailor] Ah, sulphur and old rags,

1250
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,469
something odd about this.

1251
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,096
- [Sailor] Stuff it out, Parsons.

1252
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,681
The rest ya, deck side, double.

1253
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:06,310
(rope creaking)

1254
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,689
- [Prisoner] No hope to get out of here?

1255
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:11,774
No hope?

1256
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:12,650
Hey, hey.

1257
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:18,739
(rope creaking)
(suspenseful music continues)

1258
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,201
(hand thudding)
(sailor grunts)

1259
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,327
- [Sailor] It's battened down.

1260
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,412
Let's try the fore hatch.

1261
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:34,755
(rope creaking)
(suspenseful music continues)

1262
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,430
(water splashing)

1263
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,225
(hand thudding)

1264
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,310
- [Sailor] Deck, ahoy.

1265
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,229
On, deck, sir, on deck.

1266
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,149
On deck, sir.
- Aye.

1267
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,867
- [Sailor] On deck, open up.

1268
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:07,913
Unbatten.
(hand thudding)

1269
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,049
(gentle music)

1270
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,473
(water sloshing)

1271
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,190
- A long way to go.

1272
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,650
- But don't you think we
ought to come about now?

1273
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,154
(oar creaking)

1274
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:42,948
- Look.

1275
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,869
(dramatic music)

1276
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:52,750
(suspenseful music)

1277
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:56,921
Gilbert's alive.

1278
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,507
- [Tom] What makes you so sure?

1279
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,552
- Nobody else would've
searched in this direction.

1280
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,304
- Unless someone informed on us.

1281
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,605
- [Captain] I trust you enjoyed
your excursion, gentlemen.

1282
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,065
- While it lasted, we did.

1283
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,733
- You wouldn't have liked
the coast of Africa,

1284
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:20,903
fever, hostile natives, dangerous animals.

1285
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,280
Shouldn't there be three of you?

1286
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:25,199
- Mrs. Garth is dead.

1287
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,076
- Oh, how did that happen?

1288
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:30,287
- She drowned herself when
the Charlotte came in sight.

1289
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:33,290
- And neither of you tried to save her?

1290
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,334
- So you could hang her?

1291
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,046
- I shall be lenient.

1292
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:41,131
You chose to escape by the sea,

1293
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,008
and you shall be punished by the sea.

1294
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,552
Mr. Green, you'll make preparations

1295
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,096
for keelhauling the prisoners.

1296
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,890
- Captain Gilbert, no
man has been keelhauled

1297
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:52,142
on an English ship for 50 years.

1298
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,311
- [Captain] Oh, I don't
think it's been that long.

1299
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,065
- Why don't you hang us
and have done with it?

1300
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,277
- I've seen hangings
but never a keelhauling.

1301
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,780
Do your duty, Mr. Green.

1302
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,198
- [Mr. Green] Aye, aye, sir.

1303
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:07,992
Get a move on.

1304
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,997
(footsteps plodding)

1305
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,626
- Make sure that block's well greased.

1306
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:18,794
- Bo's'n.

1307
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,212
- What is it, Reverend?

1308
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,839
- I have, of course read of keelhauling,

1309
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,967
but I'm not quite clear
as to how it's done.

1310
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,719
- Maybe it best remain that way.

1311
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,679
- Only one in 50's ever lived through it.

1312
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,472
- It's nothing really, Parson,

1313
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,141
if you can do without breathing.

1314
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,226
- The punishment, as
the name says, consists

1315
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,477
of dragging a man down

1316
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,314
and under the keel by means of two lines.

1317
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,899
One's attached to his
feet to drag him around

1318
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:41,984
and the other to his neck

1319
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:44,403
to make sure the journey's not too quick.

1320
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,948
- And how many times is he pulled across?

1321
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,658
- Generally, once is enough.

1322
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,369
(drum rumbling)

1323
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,129
- Mr. Green.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1324
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,547
- Commence punishment.

1325
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,132
- [Mr. Green] Aye, aye, sir.

1326
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,216
Hoist away.

1327
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,219
(pulleys clanking)
(drum rumbling)

1328
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,304
High enough.

1329
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:12,765
Lower away.

1330
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:17,811
(pulleys clanking)
(drum rumbling)

1331
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,273
(water sloshing)

1332
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,692
(metal clanging)

1333
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:26,445
(pulleys clanking)
(drum rumbling)

1334
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,822
18 on the landboard side.

1335
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,407
- All the way on the key lines.

1336
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:33,786
Keep 'em taut.

1337
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,377
- Stay where you are.

1338
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:47,466
- They're coming up, sir.

1339
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:52,471
(water sloshing)
(drum rumbling)

1340
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,642
- Are they alive?

1341
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:57,976
- I think so, sir.

1342
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,103
Fast heaving.

1343
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,354
Shall I haul 'em aboard?

1344
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:05,150
- No, take them under the keel
again to the starboard side.

1345
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:08,821
- Slag away.

1346
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,240
- [Sailor] Haul in on the starboard side.

1347
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,741
(drum rumbling)

1348
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,617
- Pay off.

1349
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:19,957
(pulleys clanking)
(drum rumbling)

1350
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:26,004
(water sloshing)

1351
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:29,299
- Never live.

1352
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,887
- Not so fast, put a
strain on those lines.

1353
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:38,600
(pulleys clanking)
(drum rumbling)

1354
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,102
- [Sailor] The line's twisted.

1355
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,271
- Captain Gilbert.

1356
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,772
- There seems to be
some trouble, Mr. Green.

1357
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:44,982
What is it?

1358
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,608
- One of the lines has bowed, sir.

1359
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:47,860
- [Captain] Well, clear it.

1360
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:48,735
- Aye, aye, sir.

1361
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,117
- You've got to bring them aboard.

1362
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,618
- Are you sure you mean them?

1363
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,828
- Doesn't matter what I mean.

1364
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,329
You've got to bring them aboard.

1365
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:03,500
- [Mr. Green] Clear for
hauling 'em in, sir.

1366
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,710
- Haul them onto the deck.

1367
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,003
Let's have a look at them.

1368
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,467
- This is the most barbarous
proceeding I've ever witnessed.

1369
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,302
- You think so, Reverend?

1370
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,930
(chains clanging)
(drum rumbling)

1371
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:21,935
(pulleys clanking)
(drum rumbling)

1372
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,859
(footsteps plodding)

1373
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:33,864
(boat creaking)
(water sloshing)

1374
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,084
- Is he alive?

1375
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:46,919
- Mr. Green.

1376
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,965
Their condition?

1377
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,175
- Tallant's alive, sir.

1378
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,930
- And Spencer?
- Dead, sir.

1379
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:05,103
- Clear the decks.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1380
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,021
- Captain Gilbert.

1381
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,775
You now have three deaths to answer for,

1382
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:12,069
Spencer, Mrs. Garth, and her son,

1383
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,362
and no doubt there will be more,

1384
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,155
but you may be sure, if I survive,

1385
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,740
I shall make a full
report to Governor Philip

1386
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,492
when we reach Botany Bay.

1387
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,536
- I'm sure he'll find
that most interesting.

1388
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:23,747
(footsteps plodding)

1389
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:26,500
(majestic music)

1390
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:47,271
(majestic music continues)

1391
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,866
- [Sailor] Land, ho.

1392
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,035
Land, ho.

1393
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,913
- Where are we?

1394
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,665
- [Sailor] Two points on landboard bow.

1395
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,505
- Our destination, Mr. Green.

1396
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:19,428
237 days, fine passage, I
shall make an entry in the log.

1397
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,531
- Let go of the starboard anchor.

1398
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,866
(water splashing)

1399
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,869
- Get up forward.
- Pull upside with the boat.

1400
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:48,874
(pulleys clanking)
(boat clattering)

1401
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,209
- [Sailor] Stay with
the boat (indistinct).

1402
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,712
(chains clanging)

1403
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:55,380
- Mr. Tallant.

1404
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,466
- Sentry, escort the Reverend
Thynne and this woman

1405
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,259
to the boat at the gangway at once.

1406
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:08,810
Where's the other prisoner?

1407
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,355
- The other?

1408
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,898
There was only Mr. Tallant, sir.

1409
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,609
- Perhaps I forgot to tell you.
We've had another prisoner for some time,

1410
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,778
a certain Mrs. Garth

1411
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:20,697
whose friends elected to confine her
forward of the cable tier,

1412
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,616
a most unhealthy spot.

1413
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:23,867
However, she survived.

1414
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,411
When you take this man
ashore, hand him over

1415
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,497
to the guards in charge
of the Encouragement.

1416
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,915
- Aye, aye, sir.

1417
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:30,749
Come on.

1418
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,338
(majestic music)

1419
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,056
- [Sailor] Come on now.

1420
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:49,017
Get ashore and take
your belongings with ya.

1421
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,602
- [Prisoner] Only too happy to oblige.

1422
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,689
(footsteps plodding)

1423
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:04,741
(prisoners chattering indistinctly)

1424
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,994
(Moll gasps)

1425
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,708
- [Sailor] They're is harmless
as foul in a barnyard.

1426
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,168
- Aye, but do they know that?

1427
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,922
- [Sailor] Keep walking.

1428
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,717
(majestic music)

1429
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,392
- Welcome to New South Wales, Captain.

1430
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:31,226
- Thank you.

1431
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:32,811
- The governor is waiting for you.

1432
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:39,192
(monkeys howling)
(birds chirping)

1433
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,280
- I've heard your
evidence, Captain Gilbert,

1434
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,824
and the testimony of the Reverend
Thynne and the two persons

1435
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:48,410
against whom you have
brought these charges.

1436
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,536
- Surely, there can be no question

1437
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:50,704
of their guilt, Governor Philip.

1438
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,622
- No, there is no question as to that.

1439
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,666
- And no doubt they'll hang.

1440
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,210
- There are two purposes
behind transportation,

1441
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:01,006
Captain Gilbert, the one to
give people a chance to reform,

1442
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:03,425
and the other to open up a new world.

1443
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,302
Neither is accomplished with corpses.

1444
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:10,432
Now, as to the disposition
of the prisoners,

1445
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,934
there are certain
mitigating circumstances,

1446
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:17,355
your natural resentment
over the fate of your son

1447
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:21,067
and your conviction that you
have been treated unjustly.

1448
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,236
However, the removal of
the colony from Botany Bay

1449
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,363
to this port has seriously
disrupted our programme,

1450
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:28,158
and I, I'm not prepared to
wait upon the bickerings

1451
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,786
that attend upon a protracted trial,

1452
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,704
but when the case is reopened,

1453
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:35,540
the mitigating circumstances will have

1454
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,250
the fullest consideration.

1455
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,920
- [Captain] Why not free them
now and have done with it?

1456
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:50,806
- [Governor] Put this man for
the time being at hard labour.

1457
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,140
- Go on, up the hill.

1458
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,060
(hammers thudding)

1459
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,437
Take it up.

1460
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:02,442
(hammers thudding)
(birds squawking)

1461
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,625
- What's a word from Sabb?

1462
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:21,920
- He's got the chart, Hugh,
a copy of Captain Cook's.

1463
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,505
- Does it show the Dutch Islands?

1464
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:26,383
- Aye, both Java and Timor.

1465
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,927
We can't figure out how we get there.

1466
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,137
- We'll get there. We have to swim soon.

1467
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,894
(saw rasping)

1468
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,231
- Not hungry?

1469
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:45,402
(monkeys howling)
(birds chirping)

1470
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:46,319
You hungry?

1471
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,241
(Sally laughs)

1472
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:54,452
(birds chirping)

1473
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:58,790
(prisoners chattering indistinctly)

1474
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:06,756
(water sloshing)

1475
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:08,258
- Saw the American this morning.

1476
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,719
- How was he?

1477
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:12,053
- Seems to be holding up.

1478
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,722
- Mm.
- And should be

1479
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:15,974
with you smuggling him food each day.

1480
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,936
This is probably his washing, too.

1481
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,479
- And if it is, what of that?

1482
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,814
- Well, nothing.

1483
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:25,859
So why, that he'll settle down long enough

1484
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,444
for you to halter him?

1485
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:31,740
- He won't the way things
are now, but I have a plan.

1486
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:35,994
- Hmm, that's always
useful if it's a good one.

1487
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,623
- It's a good one, all right.

1488
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,708
The parson has promised
me to ask Governor Philip

1489
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:45,337
to make him a doctor, and
when he has something useful

1490
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,380
to do, and he feels people trust him-

1491
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,298
- Mistress Sally.

1492
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,469
May I have a word with you?

1493
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:56,389
(birds chirping)

1494
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,563
- What do you want?

1495
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,411
- You've been much in my mind of late

1496
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,456
since I had business to show
up with Governor Philip,

1497
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,708
I thought I should
satisfy myself about you.

1498
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,295
- That's very kind of you.

1499
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:29,214
- How do you like your new occupation?

1500
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:32,801
- It's not half as bad
as I thought it would be.

1501
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,512
- Good, but the smoke from open fires

1502
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:38,014
and the vapours from boiling soap,

1503
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,933
not the best thing for the complexion.

1504
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:45,355
- By the time I leave here,
my complexion won't matter.

1505
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,233
- My vessel leaves for
home in a week or two.

1506
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,567
It shall be a very pleasant voyage,

1507
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:52,237
no troublesome cargo, ample quarters,

1508
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:54,280
the best of food and wine,

1509
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,117
interesting excursions ashore
to Cape Town and Tenerife.

1510
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,538
- What happens when we get to England?

1511
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,041
- A word in the right quarter,

1512
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:07,669
and a pardon is not beyond
the realm of possibility.

1513
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,799
- I have a feeling I'm gonna like it here.

1514
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:14,968
- Hmm.

1515
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:19,889
I'm afraid you're allowing
sentiment to cloud your judgement.

1516
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,391
- Yes, that's right, I am.

1517
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:29,649
- The man's a thief, convicted
and sentenced for life,

1518
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,651
and destined, I'm sure, to hang someday.

1519
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,655
- He's not a thief, and he'll not hang.

1520
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:40,118
(birds chirping)

1521
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:46,583
- We shall see.

1522
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,383
(water sloshing)
(birds squawking)

1523
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,260
- At the suggestion of
the reverend Dr. Thynne,

1524
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,470
I've been going over your record.

1525
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,847
I note that your medical
studies in London were centred

1526
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,058
on fever and plague.

1527
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,559
- [Hugh] That's right.

1528
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,978
- I'm disturbed over a
second unexplained death

1529
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:08,980
in the new settlement at Norfolk Island.

1530
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,191
- What is that to do with me?

1531
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,486
- If it should be fever or
plague, I would like your help.

1532
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,112
- Do you trust a convict to be a doctor?

1533
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,448
- If your story is true,
you're not a convict.

1534
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:20,533
And even if you were,

1535
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:23,244
New South Wales and I
would still want your aid.

1536
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,706
This can be a great land,
given the same chances

1537
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,541
that your own America has had,

1538
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,294
a soil by the millions of
acres waiting for the touch

1539
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:34,297
of the plough, pastures
bigger than all of England

1540
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:37,550
waiting for sheep and cattle,
harbours waiting for cities.

1541
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,177
And with England already overpopulated,

1542
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,930
this could easily realise
the dreams of a new world.

1543
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,725
I'd like to persuade you, if I can,

1544
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,894
to remain here for the rest of your life.

1545
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,312
We need men like you.

1546
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:53,233
Failing that, I'd like to
make a bargain with you.

1547
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,692
- What kind of a bargain?

1548
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,862
- If you'll assist our doctors
until your pardon arrives,

1549
01:16:58,739 --> 01:16:59,989
I will drop the charges brought

1550
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,574
against you by Captain Gilbert.

1551
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:05,453
- May I think it over?
- By all means.

1552
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,876
- Thank you, sir.

1553
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:14,587
(pensive music)

1554
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,849
(footsteps plodding)

1555
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:30,145
- Somehow, I feel you've
bungled things, the way you did

1556
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:33,481
the night he and Spencer got
free in the ship's boat.

1557
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,400
You're positive he doesn't suspect you?

1558
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,901
- Yes.
- And equally positive

1559
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:39,070
he no longer intends to escape?

1560
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:41,865
- [Conspirator] I'm no
perishing mind reader, but...

1561
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,159
(dramatic music)

1562
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,243
- But?

1563
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,162
- He no longer talks about it.

1564
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:51,749
Oakly's come to an
understanding with Nellie Garth,

1565
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:55,086
and Tallant's near one
with Mistress Munroe

1566
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,337
if I'm any judge.

1567
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,633
He's taken to his medical
work like a duck to water.

1568
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,428
- No escape, I should have to do something

1569
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,930
about that when I return
from Norfolk Island.

1570
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,599
- Norfolk Island?

1571
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,267
Isn't there supposed to be plague there?

1572
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,061
- Nonsense, two deaths from malnutrition.

1573
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:15,815
I have the glimmering of an
idea, Sabb, a very neat idea

1574
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:18,026
that will finish him
no matter what he does.

1575
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:23,072
Make certain no one sees
you as you go ashore.

1576
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:27,243
- Not the easiest thing for
a man of my girth. (laughs)

1577
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:34,042
(birds squawking)
(regal music)

1578
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:38,880
- Stand there.

1579
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,384
- Tallant, Captain Gilbert
has come here by boat

1580
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:47,889
from Botany Bay to discuss
his, uh, charges against you.

1581
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,059
- During my stay at Norfolk
Island and yesterday

1582
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,436
at Botany Bay, I had the
opportunity to review

1583
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:56,940
my admiralty law, especially those parts

1584
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:00,276
concerning mutiny and
insurrection upon the high seas.

1585
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,403
I found it is my duty to present the facts

1586
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,530
before the correct authority,

1587
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:08,368
which in this case
appears to be in London.

1588
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:10,411
It is also my duty to
present the defendant

1589
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,579
at the same time.

1590
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:14,999
- You mean to take me back to England?

1591
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,252
- I have no choice in the matter.

1592
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,003
The Charlotte sails in three days.

1593
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,466
- I'm afraid there's
nothing I can do, Tallant.

1594
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,177
- Why do you tell me this now?

1595
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,140
- I felt it was only fair
to give you the opportunity

1596
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:32,475
to prepare for your voyage

1597
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:34,686
and make such farewells as you care to.

1598
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,313
Good day, sir.

1599
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,942
(footsteps plodding)

1600
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,653
- Even if I survive the
voyage, which I won't,

1601
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:44,988
I'll be hanged when I get to England.

1602
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,614
- You have no choice but to escape.

1603
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,491
- What I wouldn't give for a
chance at Gilbert's gullet.

1604
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:49,659
- You're not in this, Tom.

1605
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,119
- Do you think I'd desert you now?

1606
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,329
- [Ned] Count me in, too,
whenever you're ready to go.

1607
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,539
- And me.

1608
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:56,249
- We'll need supplies and ammunition.

1609
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,876
- Too bad we can't make
use of Gilbert's hunting.

1610
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,044
- Hunting, where?

1611
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:01,629
- Stillwater Cove.

1612
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,881
He's taking the ship boat
with a couple of men.

1613
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,718
He's gonna camp there while
the Charlotte's at Botany Bay.

1614
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:07,760
- Where's Stillwater Cove?

1615
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,762
- About 10 miles short of there.

1616
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:13,558
- That's it, Gilbert,
and escape in one bundle.

1617
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,851
- That don't sound half bad.

1618
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:17,854
- Ammunition, supplies,
and a good, stout boat,

1619
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,564
we're practically in Java already.

1620
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,693
- [Ned] And we can use
Gilbert's hide for a sail.

1621
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,279
(gentle music)

1622
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:31,659
- What is it, Parson?

1623
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:32,744
- I've been given permission

1624
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,704
to speak to you, Hugh, over here.

1625
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,797
(birds chirping)

1626
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:46,674
Sally.

1627
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:55,141
I'll wait, Sally.

1628
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,730
- Mrs. Garth just told me
what you're going to do.

1629
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:01,773
You must be out of your mind.

1630
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,358
You'll all be caught and hanged.

1631
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,234
- [Hugh] How long do you think

1632
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:06,944
Gilbert would let me
live on the Charlotte?

1633
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:11,074
- Well, couldn't you just hide
in the back country till he's gone?

1634
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:14,619
- Ship back to England on the next boat?

1635
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:15,787
- The parson's sure he can persuade

1636
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,246
Governor Phillip into sheltering you.

1637
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,581
- Philip wouldn't dare.

1638
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:21,084
Even if he did, I'm
tired of being a convict.

1639
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,004
- What about the others?

1640
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,508
Do you care about them?

1641
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,470
No, I suppose you don't.

1642
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,389
You're blind to everyone but yourself,

1643
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:36,641
blind to what you've already done

1644
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:38,851
to Mr. Spencer and the Garth boy,

1645
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:41,521
blind to what you're doing
to Nellie and to Tom Oakly,

1646
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:47,360
to me.
(gentle music continues)

1647
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:48,236
- Sorry.

1648
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,990
(gentle music continues)

1649
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:04,585
(birds squawking)

1650
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:09,590
(gun clanking)
(pensive music)

1651
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,385
Sure about the sentry?

1652
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:15,096
- Sure as I am there's beer in England.

1653
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,139
- All clear.

1654
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:24,439
(birds squawking)
(suspenseful music)

1655
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:43,416
(monkeys barking)
(birds chirping)

1656
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:54,343
(footsteps plodding)

1657
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,441
(suspenseful music)

1658
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,237
Did you see the black man back there?

1659
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,698
- There's been a dozen or so
following us for the past hour.

1660
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,241
- Well, what's to be done?

1661
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:19,702
- If they're anything
like the Indians at home, if we...

1662
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,162
don't bother them,
they won't bother us.

1663
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,040
Come on.

1664
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,924
(waves lapping)

1665
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:43,434
(leaves rustling)
(waves lapping)

1666
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:00,993
(waves continue lapping)

1667
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:13,047
(wood clattering)
(fire crackling)

1668
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,550
(wings fluttering)

1669
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,802
- Here, did you hear something?

1670
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,178
- No.

1671
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,263
- Stay where you are.

1672
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:29,939
Inching, can take that musket.

1673
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,234
Where's Gilbert?

1674
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:35,820
- He's in the tent.

1675
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:36,779
- Keep 'em covered.

1676
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:44,495
(canvas rustling)

1677
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:45,746
- Ah, Mr. Tallant.

1678
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:47,832
- [Hugh] Get out of there.

1679
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,671
- Welcome to Stillwater Cove.

1680
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,172
- I don't think we'd
be so welcome, Captain,

1681
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:56,465
if you knew what we intended.

1682
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:57,300
- Oh, but I do.

1683
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:59,051
You intend to steal my
boats and such provisions

1684
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,387
as we have here and then proceed to Java,

1685
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:02,888
having presumably wreaked some sort

1686
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,473
of vengeance upon my person.

1687
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:07,893
- You seem pretty sure of our plans.

1688
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,979
- I am, and also of mine.

1689
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:13,441
Now, if you'll be good
enough to look behind you.

1690
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,067
(dramatic music)

1691
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,402
- Down with those muskets.

1692
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:19,322
Down with them, I said.

1693
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,908
Line them up by the boat
and put them in irons.

1694
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:23,743
- Very well, sir.

1695
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,828
All right, line 'em up over there.

1696
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,371
- I was afraid I might
have to wait some time

1697
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,624
before seeing you hanged,
gentlemen, but now.

1698
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,628
Sabb.
- Yes, sir?

1699
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,713
- Put this is my tent. Fetch my pistol.

1700
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:38,090
- Yes, Captain, that I will.

1701
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,099
(dramatic music continues)

1702
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:51,020
- Your unsavoury friend
has been most useful to me.

1703
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,897
Without his loyalty and resourcefulness,

1704
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,649
this scheme would never have evolved.

1705
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:55,858
Fetter them securely, Sergeant.

1706
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,277
The Charlotte won't be here
until sometime tomorrow.

1707
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,111
- Aye, aye, sir.

1708
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,404
- I suppose you realise, Tallant,

1709
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:01,656
I never had the slightest intention

1710
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,574
of taking you back to London.

1711
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:04,408
- I do now.

1712
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:06,744
As long as I'm gonna hang...

1713
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:11,749
(fist thudding)
(dramatic music)

1714
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:17,546
- Your pistol, sir.

1715
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,133
(gun clanking)

1716
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,471
- I'm not gonna kill you now,

1717
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,932
'cause that would deprive me
of the very great pleasure

1718
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,350
of watching Mistress Sally's face

1719
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:31,227
when you dance at the rope's end.

1720
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,521
- Sir, there are some natives watching

1721
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:34,689
from the brush over there.

1722
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,107
It looks as if they mean to attack.

1723
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:37,858
- [Captain] A shot or
two will discourage that.

1724
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:39,819
Discharge a few rounds at them.
- Very well, sir.

1725
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,487
- [Hugh] Better leave them alone
if you don't want trouble.

1726
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:43,239
- Nonsense, take cover.

1727
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,992
(suspenseful music)

1728
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:52,540
Fire at will.

1729
01:26:52,582 --> 01:26:55,584
(gunshots blasting)

1730
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:00,715
(spear thudding)
(gunshots blasting)

1731
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,091
- [Soldier] There are
some more over there.

1732
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:04,176
Don't let them get into the clearing.

1733
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,678
(Captain Gilbert grunts)

1734
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:06,887
(gunshots blasting)

1735
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,723
- [Soldier] I can't see them, sir.

1736
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:09,598
- [Soldier] Shoot higher.

1737
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:14,645
(gunshots blasting)
(dramatic music)

1738
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,482
- I say.
- Reload as fast as you can.

1739
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,985
Tread carefully.

1740
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:24,405
- Pull it out.

1741
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:25,698
- Do no good.

1742
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:26,782
- Blasted, you pull it out.

1743
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:28,200
- You'll bleed to death.

1744
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:29,118
- You're lying.

1745
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:34,165
(gunshots blasting)
(dramatic music continues)

1746
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:44,842
Perhaps I shan't see you hang after all.

1747
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:51,265
(gunshots blasting)
(dramatic music continues)

1748
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:01,066
- Too exposed, should
get behind the ridge.

1749
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,617
All right, controlled volleys.

1750
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:12,495
- [Soldier] Take Aim.

1751
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:15,498
Fire.

1752
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:18,626
(gunshots blasting)

1753
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:19,460
Load.

1754
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,921
- [Soldier] I'll load for ya.

1755
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:26,967
- Take aim.

1756
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:30,638
Fire.

1757
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:35,684
(gunshots blasting)
(dramatic music continues)

1758
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:38,896
Aim.

1759
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:44,360
Fire.
(gunshots blasting)

1760
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:45,194
Aim.

1761
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:52,201
Fire.
(gunshots blasting)

1762
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:03,379
- Not a sign of them anymore.

1763
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,927
- We got them.

1764
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:11,595
- And we've got you.

1765
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,978
(waves lapping)

1766
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:27,987
Now, your arm's good as new.

1767
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,905
- What do you intend to do now?

1768
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,992
- Take the boat.
- I meant about us.

1769
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:37,204
- You can send one of your men
back to the settlement for help.

1770
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:40,165
- I found Sabb, Hugh, what was left of him

1771
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,459
after the black men got through.

1772
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:44,003
- Four dead, two wounded.

1773
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,714
- Three wounded, I've
got a scratch on my arm.

1774
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:49,508
- Take off your shirt, and
I'll have a look at it.

1775
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:50,718
Tom, load the boat.

1776
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:51,552
- All right.

1777
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:52,511
- Sit down.

1778
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:53,929
- All right, you men, lend a hand here.

1779
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:57,182
Get that gear into the boat.

1780
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:04,273
- It's deep, but the bone's unhurt.

1781
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:07,026
Couple of weeks, you'll never know.

1782
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,738
How long have you had
that lump on the arm?

1783
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,240
- Mm, two or three days, I think.

1784
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:14,116
- Headaches and chills?

1785
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,951
- Yes, yes, how did you know?

1786
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,455
- Anybody else got any swelling like that?

1787
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,832
- Uh, yes, uh, Malfi over there for one

1788
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,709
and one or two others aboard ship.

1789
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:24,585
- Who's Malfi?

1790
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:28,505
- That'd be me.
- Hugh, Hugh.

1791
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:31,592
The Charlotte coming into shore.

1792
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:34,345
(majestic music)

1793
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,559
- We'll never get away in the boat now.

1794
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,269
- We'll have to head inland.

1795
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:45,147
- No, we're heading
back for the settlement.

1796
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:48,108
- Hugh, that don't make sense.

1797
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:50,694
- It will if we get that
before the Charlotte does.

1798
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:54,657
(regal music)

1799
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,579
- Governor Philip.
- What is it?

1800
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:03,332
- Three of the escaped prisoners, sir.

1801
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,376
They were caught just outside the colony.

1802
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,213
(footsteps plodding)

1803
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:10,881
Tallant, there'll be no
possible explanation.

1804
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:13,050
- Punish us any way you want, Governor.

1805
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:14,635
But first, make sure that nobody lands

1806
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:15,928
from the Charlotte when it arrives.

1807
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:17,304
- And why should I do that?

1808
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:20,849
- There's plague on board.

1809
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,185
- Are you certain of this?
- Yes, sir.

1810
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,145
- [Governor] See that the ship
is quarantined on arrival.

1811
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:26,021
- Very good, sir.

1812
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:29,942
(gentle music)

1813
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,447
- Pettis here is our last case, Doctor.

1814
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:36,407
- When was he taken?

1815
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:39,159
- Nine days ago.
- Hmm, and none since then?

1816
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:40,202
- None and no fever.

1817
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,288
- You performed wonders.

1818
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,331
The governor will be delighted.

1819
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,667
- Then you take my word
for that it's over?

1820
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,877
- Even if I didn't, I can hardly refuse

1821
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:50,838
to believe the evidence of my own eyes.

1822
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,759
You may hold on the quarantine, Pendleton.

1823
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,804
- [Pendleton] Aye, aye, sir.

1824
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:01,598
(dramatic music)

1825
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:06,729
(children laughing)

1826
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:12,651
- Sally, someone wants to see ya

1827
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:15,487
on the knoll back at camp.

1828
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,488
Go on, lass.

1829
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:21,702
(gentle music)

1830
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:26,081
(birds squawking)

1831
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:32,963
(gentle music continues)

1832
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,518
- [Hugh] Sally.

1833
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:57,696
- What are you doing here?

1834
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,450
- Waiting for you.

1835
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:05,162
- Is it true the governor's
dropped all charges against you?

1836
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:06,205
- Against all of us.

1837
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:10,501
He's offered to let me go back
to England to get my pardon.

1838
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:15,631
- When will you be sailing?

1839
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,095
- I won't.

1840
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:27,768
(gentle music continues)
(birds chirping)

1841
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:46,286
(leaves crunching)

1842
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:52,084
(majestic music)
