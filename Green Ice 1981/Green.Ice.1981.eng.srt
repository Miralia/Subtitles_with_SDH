- If I knew that, I'd be flying.

51
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,874
[Woman] You headed to the coast?

52
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,124

(seashell curtain clattering)

54

- Of course.

56
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,707
- Great.

57
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,957
(dramatic light music)

58
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,082
- Why don't you give a tweak

59
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,915
to your barostatic micro switch

60
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:28,874
or watch your TOT.

61
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,790

(lively upbeat music)

64
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,415
I'm Joe Wiley.

65
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,624
- Great.

66
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,165
- What do they call you?

67
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,499
- Holbrook.

68
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,957
- That's it?
- That's it.

69
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,040
- I thought it was the igniter circuit.

70
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:00,957
- How'd you know that?

71
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,415
- I'm an electronics engineer?

72
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,665
I mean, that's what I do for a living.

73
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,415
Actually, I think of myself.
More of an ideas man,

74
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,540
one good gimmick, set for life.

75
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,582
- I thought most of the good
gimmicks have been taken.

76
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,374
- Oh no. I've had at
least a hundred of them.

77
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,957
Everything from suntan
bells to mung beans.

78
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,290
- What are mung beans?

79
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,332
- Bean sprouts?

80
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,624
Unfortunately, rats ate my first harvest

81
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,332
before I could sell 'em.

82
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,832
That put me back about three grand.

83
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,749
I got an ex-wife who wants more alimony,

84
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,332
they've upped the rent on my apartment,

85
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,124
and oh yeah, I just lost my job.

86
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,499
- So that's your story, huh?

87
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,374
- That's it.

88
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,457
What's yours?

89
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,040
- I'm from Philadelphia.

90
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,124
I live in Mexico City.

91
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,665
That's my helicopter

92
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,957
and I'm on my way to Las
Hadas for a quiet weekend.

93
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,082
Make a right up ahead.

94
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,874
- Got it.

95
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,874
(lively upbeat music continues)

96
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,457
(water sloshing)

97
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,290
- So what made you choose Mexico?

98
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,207
- Well, actually, I missed
the plane to Hawaii.

99
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,165
And Mexico seemed affordable and nice.

100
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,665
Have you ever heard of La Mordida?

101
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,999
- No. What's that?

102
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,457
- That, Wiley, is the bite,

103
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,082
Spanish word for inflation.

104
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,374
Maybe you should give Las Hadas a try.

105
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,874
- What's there?

106
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,582
- There are a lot of wealthy women there.

107
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,665
It's a gold mine for any man

108
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,040
with a little charm and initiative.

109
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,457
I really impressed you, huh?

110
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,624
- There's only one problem.

111
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,749
- What's that?

112
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,040
- Women are going for
younger men these days.

113
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,832
Well, nothing beats experience.

114
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,457
- Except stamina.

115
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,624
(bright upbeat music)

116
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,040
(car engine rumbling)

117
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,874
- I think I'm wearing the wrong car.

118
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,457
- Don't sell yourself short, Wiley.

119
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,082
You do all right.

120
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,124
You got a good body.

121
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,374
(car honking)

122
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,207
- What a surprise, madam.

123
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,165
Welcome to Las Hadas.

124
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,540
Let me help you.

125
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:46,999
- Senora Holbrook.

126
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,915
- Hello, Carlos.
- So delighted to see you.

127
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,207
We didn't think you were coming.

128
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,207
Senor Argenti will be so happy.

129
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,165
- The man in the blue shirt.

130
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,415
Do the impossible,

131
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,957
find him a room for the night.

132
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,040
- [Carlos] Of course.

133
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,124
(gentle suspenseful music)

134
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,415
- Hello?

135
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,582
What the hell?

136
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,832
- I thought this was my suite.

137
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,707
- (speaks in Spanish), senor.

138
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,790
This apartment is for Senor Prentis.

139
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,624
You see?

140
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,624
(speaks in Spanish)

141
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,457
- Well, I'm,

142
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,374
I'm sure you can find Mr.
Prentis a better suite.

143
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,457
(person speaking in Spanish)

144
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,915
Sorry about the mix up.

145
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,124
- Oh, that's perfectly all right.

146
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,082
Come on, I wasted enough time.

147
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,124
(phone ringing)

148
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:51,957
- Hello,

149
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,082
- [Caller] Mr. Prentis, the
samples have been delivered.

150
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:55,915
- What?

151
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,499
- [Caller] In the draw beside your bed.

152
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,207
(gems clicking)

153
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,624
- I'm looking at them now.

154
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,957
- [Caller] You are familiar
with our operation.

155
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,957
We propose the following,

156
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,540
6,000 carats at 500 a carat.

157
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,915
The quality of course equal
to those you now have.

158
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,290
- That sounds reasonable.

159
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,040
- [Caller] We'll show you
further samples in the morning.

160
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:28,957
- Where?

161
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,082
- [Caller] Playa Soledad at nine o'clock.

162
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,707
(gentle music)

163
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,332
- 6,500.

164
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,457
(lively sultry music)

165
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,707
- Liliana, you look divine.

166
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,082
(lively wondrous music)

167
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,499
(group chattering)

168
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,165
- Hi.

169
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,415
Are you here alone?

170
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,499
- Yeah, my wife couldn't make it.

171
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,040
- Oh, that's too bad.

172
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,374
May I ask why?

173
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,540
- She just divorced me.

174
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,290
- Oh, did she take you for everything?

175
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,082
- No, I got to keep the goldfish.

176
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,165
- Oh.

177
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,040
- Looks good to me.

178
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,624
- Oh, lunch tomorrow?

179
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,665
- I can't.

180
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,457
- Would it make any
difference if I were rich?

181
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,249
- But you aren't, are you, Wiley?

182
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,582
- Isn't she a little
outta your price range?

183
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,624
- Not for long.

184
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,082
- I believe you have a Mr.
Prentis registered here.

185
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:03,915
- Yes.

186
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,082
- Would you make sure that he gets this?

187
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,415
- For you, senor, it would be a pleasure.

188
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,082
- Mr. Prentis?
- [Prentis] Yes, thank you.

189
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,165
- Oh, I'm glad you liked them.

190
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:15,999
As the first step,

191
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,665
let me propose 6,000
carats at $600 a carat,

192
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,707
the quality the same as the samples.

193
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,915
(car engine rumbling)

194
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,040
(waves splashing)

195
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:36,957
(car door thuds)

196
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,832
(waves splashing)

197
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,332
Hi.

198
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,665
- We thought you might have
gone to the wrong beach.

199
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,332
They all look so much alike.

200
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,874
You know Mr. Prentis?

201
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,665
(Joe grunts)

202
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,790
(bodies thudding)

203
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,790
(gun firing)

204
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,082
- [Prentis] Drive him into the sea!

205
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,082
(guns firing)

206
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,582
(waves crashing)

207
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,124
(guns firing)

208
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,124
(Joe groans)

209
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,874
(waves crashing)

210
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,832
(guns firing)

211
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,290
(water splashing)

212
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,374
(thrilling music)

213
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,582
- Welcome aboard.

214
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,707
(Joe groans)

215
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,957
(crowd chattering)

216
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,332
Out.

217
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,249
Here, eat this,

218
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,165
it'll help you get your strength back.

219
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,499
Pull your pants down.

220
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:25,915
- What?

221
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,207
- Well, unless you wanna
wait until it gets affected.

222
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,290
- All right, I can do it.

223
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,040
- Here, hold this.

224
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,290
(Joe groans)

225
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,124
- Ow.

226
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:38,957
How does it look?

227
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,290
- You'll survive as long
as you don't look down.

228
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,415
So you're really an electronics engineer?

229
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,874
- Yeah, and I'm a pretty good one too.

230
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,540
- Hmm, it's hard to picture.

231
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,457
You're lucky it's only a flesh wound.

232
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,332
- Well, it's my flesh.

233
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,249
- It is also your fault.

234
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,915
- Well, I'm sorry if I
lost you some business.

235
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,082
- What's that supposed to mean?

236
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,665
- There's only one difference
between you and me,

237
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,624
you just happen to be in a
higher price range, that's all.

238
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,374
(Joe screams)

239
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,249
(upbeat playful music)

240
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,124
(car honking)

241
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,415
(man speaks in Spanish)

242
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,124
(Liliana speaks in Spanish)

243
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,582
(car honking)

244
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,332
(car door thuds)

245
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,499
(group speaking in Spanish)

246
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,082
- This is Mr. Wiley.

247
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,832
He'll be staying with us for a few days.

248
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,832
(staff speaks in Spanish)

249
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,665
(Joe speaks in Spanish)

250
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,207
(staff speaks in Spanish)

251
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,457
(mysterious music)

252
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,832
Welcome to my house.

253
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,790
I'm sure you'd like to rest up.

254
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,207
Josephina will show you to your room.

255
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,165
(mysterious music)

256
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,249
(dramatic music)

257
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,707
- What's the matter?

258
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,415
- Talk to me, Wiley.

259
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,874
- About what?

260
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:58,749
- Anything.

261
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,749
Tell me about one of your gimmicks.

262
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,207
- What did that priest say?

263
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,207
- It's my sister.

264
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,374
A few weeks ago,

265
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,874
she went up into the mountains
with a group of students.

266
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,707
- Where?

267
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,582
- Columbia.

268
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,957
She's been reported missing.

269
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,040
That's all I know.

270
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,207
- Why South America?

271
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,624
- Because as the younger sister,

272
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,957
she was always trying to
go one step further than me

273
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,374
and I had already gotten as far as Mexico.

274
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,332
- And your parents?

275
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,165
- Mother had the money, dad the pedigree.

276
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,832
Perfect match till they
drank a hole in the marriage.

277
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,832
I came along as a sort of penalty

278
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,540
for a mad moment in a parking lot

279
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,665
after a party in Scarsdale.

280
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,624
- And your sister?

281
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,374
- Kerry?

282
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,582
She was an act of despair
eight years later.

283
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,124
Mother left the bulk of her estate to me

284
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,624
with a provision for Kerry

285
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,665
and enough money for dad
to keep his wallet working.

286
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,915
- Does your father know about Kerry?

287
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,040
- He wouldn't be interested.

288
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,582
- What's he do?

289
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,499
- When he is not drinking?

290
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,665
He's connected with the diamond business.

291
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,415
- Then he is not hurting.

292
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,457
- Oh, if you think that money
is the answer to everything.

293
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,957
- I never had enough to know.

294
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,540
- If you did, would
your life be different?

295
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,124
- Well, I could be with a woman like you

296
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,624
and not feel insecure.

297
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,165
- You feel insecure now?

298
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,207
- In one way.

299
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,332
But in another, I feel good enough.

300
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,665
- Which way is that?

301
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:35,957
- This way.

302
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:44,790
(water splashes)

303
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:48,124
(group laughing)

304
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:48,957
- Meno.

305
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,207
- As I was on my way back to Columbia,

306
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,874
I decided to surprise you.

307
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,707
I hope I'm not intruding.

308
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,249
- Of course not.

309
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,624
I'll just tell Josephina
to prepare your room.

310
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,957
- Yes, just for one night, thank you.

311
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,957
- Well, I must change.

312
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,165
Wiley, you'll find dry
clothes in your room.

313
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,207
- Mr. Wiley.

314
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,415
I don't believe we've met.

315
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,207
How do you know Holbrook?

316
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,832
- Oh, we met while I was drowning.

317
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:26,207
- You do seem to have
a fondness for water.

318
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,082
How long do you plan to stay here?

319
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,290
- Why?

320
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,124
- I like to know better

321
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,457
the man I find in the
early hours of the morning

322
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:38,749
with my fiancee.

323
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,165
- You didn't tell me you were engaged.

324
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,457
Are you?

325
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,332
- Not only do you ask too many questions,

326
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,790
but you always ask the wrong ones.

327
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,040
- Well, who is that guy anyway?

328
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,165
- He's a very important man in Bogata.

329
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,624
- Are you gonna go away with him?

330
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,582
- He can help me find my sister.

331
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,457
Can you?

332
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,915
(gun firing)

333
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,832
(gun booms)

334
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,624
- You are a very good
spectator, Mr. Wiley.

335
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,874
You do not interfere too much.

336
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,582
- No more games tonight, Meno.

337
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:44,290
- Excuse me.

338
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,957
I must speak with Josephina.

339
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:58,457
- I understand that you're
an electronics engineer.

340
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:00,790
- That's right.

341
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,957
- In Columbia, I have
electronics for surveillance.

342
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:13,540
The best experts in the
world built by installation.

343
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:16,707
You should come and see
it and maybe work for me.

344
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,665
- What makes you think I'm good enough?

345
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:23,707
- I'm incredibly intuitive
when it comes to judging a man.

346
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,832
I'm seldom wrong.

347
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,457
Come see everything.

348
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,124
Perhaps you can improve on it.

349
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,499
I pay handsomely and you
could even steal a little.

350
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,707
Think about it.

351
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,582
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

352
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,457
- Where's Mussolini this morning?

353
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,707
- He's gone.

354
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,457
He thanks me, sends me his heart,

355
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,082
and says goodbye to you.

356
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,165
He hopes you'll come to Columbia with me.

357
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,457
- All my gear is down at Las Hadas.

358
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,082
- As far as Las Hadas is concerned,

359
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,957
you we're never registered.

360
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,707
- Oh, that's terrific.

361
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:11,332
I'm out 2,000 bucks.

362
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,374
- Well, look at the bright side,

363
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,582
you get to go to Bogota.

364
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,332
How much do you know
about emeralds, Wiley?

365
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,540
- [Joe] Well, they have a
way of causing me trouble.

366
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,874
- [Liliana] 95% of the
world's finest stones

367
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:22,957
come from Columbia.

368
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,582
The government gave up trying
to control them years ago.

369
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,665
They gave it over to a private concession.

370
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,874
- [Joe] And Argenti?

371
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,582
- [Liliana] He is the concession.

372
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,540
- [Joe] And he's the ticket
to finding his sister.

373
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:35,665
- [Liliana] Precisely.

374
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:36,832
- [Joe] And I'm invited.

375
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,749
- [Liliana] There are no
gimmicks down there, Wiley.

376
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:39,707
- [Joe] Just emeralds.

377
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,832
- [Liliana] Yes, just emeralds.

378
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:46,040
$25,000 a carat for finding a
little green chip in the mud,

379
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,707
makes killing easy.

380
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:50,290
(sombre music)

381
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,207
(bells ringing)

382
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,457
(child cries)

383
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,415
(crowd chattering)

384
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,374
(door thuds)

385
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:01,249
Tell Miguel I'm here.

386
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:04,707
(eerie electronic music)

387
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,957
(elevator door thuds)

388
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:37,249
(eerie electronic music continues)

389
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,415
- You are now in the very
heart of my concession.

390
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:47,874
We are in the center of a city,

391
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:50,999
but one word from me and
the perimeter is closed.

392
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:53,249
And up here, I'm in my own fortress.

393
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,332
Every two days,

394
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,165
the emeralds are brought
here from the mines.

395
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:01,124
60 out of every hundred are good,

396
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,957
30 are very good,

397
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,540
and 10 are the finest in the world.

398
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,874
(machine buzzing)

399
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:10,665
This is my friend Jaap,

400
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:13,165
a diamond cutter, the best.

401
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:16,582
He was called supremo when
he worked for me in Milano.

402
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,290
We left together.

403
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:21,165
How long ago was it, 10 years?

404
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,040
- 11.

405
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:24,790
- 11.

406
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:30,415
I left a world behind
and started a new life.

407
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,582
The only thing that remains
from the old world is Jaap.

408
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,707
He has stayed by my side through it all.

409
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:42,124
He never complains but
he misses the diamonds,

410
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,290
like me.

411
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,749
- Meno, Meno, forget diamonds.

412
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,332
We don't even mention the word.

413
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,040
- You're right.

414
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,915
Weight for weight and quality for quality.

415
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,624
The emerald is better, hmm?

416
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,624
- No.

417
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,165
(machines thumping)

418
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,457
- Here, we keep all our data,

419
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,457
who is interested in emeralds,
what they wish to buy.

420
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,290
We trade mostly outside the country

421
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,207
to avoid unnecessary
government inconveniences.

422
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,457
We've even done business
at certain resorts.

423
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,832
It's nice to combine
business with pleasure.

424
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,749
Don't you agree, Mr. Wiley?

425
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:28,332
Since Holbrook seems to trust you

426
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,915
and I, in turn, trust her judgement ,

427
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,165
I will now show you something

428
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,249
very few people are privileged to see.

429
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,040
(elevator thuds)

430
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,290
Other than that elevator,
there's no way in.

431
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,707
- No fire escape?

432
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,582
- No stairs.

433
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:56,249
- We are completely isolated
from above and below.

434
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,832
- What is above?

435
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,707
- The sky.

436
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,374
- I'm impressed.

437
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:07,665
- Is it not ingenious to
have my fortress in the sky

438
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,707
instead of the usual hole in the ground?

439
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,499
Now I will show you how I,
Meno Sebastiano Argenti,

440
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,040
am the most fortunate of men.

441
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,707
(door whirring)

442
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,124
Follow me please.

443
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:30,957
(dramatic electronic music)

444
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,457
You may touch if you wish.

445
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:48,040
(dramatic electronic music)

446
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:03,249
60 or $70 million worth.

447
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,832
And tomorrow, there'll be more.

448
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:13,290
(dramatic electronic music continues)

449
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:24,374
This is Jochim Kellerman,
chief of my control section.

450
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,540
Mr. Wiley, shall we continue?

451
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,332
(dramatic music)

452
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:39,374
This vault is cadmium-based steal.

453
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,082
There isn't a torch in existence

454
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:41,915
hot enough to cut through it.

455
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,290
- How do the stones get here?

456
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,082
(doors rumbling)

457
00:34:57,166 --> 00:35:00,665
(sirens blaring)

458
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:04,040
(cars honking)

459
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:06,874
(traffic roaring)

460
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,624
- All deliveries from the mines

461
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,749
come here directly by helicopter.

462
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:20,124
A plane one mile up in the
sky can set off the alarm.

463
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,249
And if anyone landed on this roof,

464
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:23,957
how would they get down?

465
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,749
You're an expert.

466
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,124
Can it be improved upon?

467
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,624
- Not by me.

468
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:57,457
(birds chirping)

469
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,207
- Mr. Wiley, we have not met.

470
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,374
I am General Botero.

471
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:06,415
The senora told me

472
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,832
you are very interested in
our ancient excavations.

473
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,665
- Is that a fact?

474
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,665
- General Botero has given us a jeep.

475
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:12,624
- Oh, terrific.

476
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,665
- Thought you'd like the idea.

477
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,457
- But the mountains, the bandidos.

478
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,124
I will send an armed escort with you,

479
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:17,957
It will be safe.

480
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:20,207
- General Botero, Wiley is a crack shot.

481
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,415
Aren't you, Wiley?

482
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,165
- Yeah, my aim's getting
better all the time.

483
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:25,540
(disc thumps)

484
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:28,707
(car engine rumbling)

485
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,332
(car engine roaring)

486
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:40,082
(car engine rumbling)

487
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:57,374
(dramatic sombre music)

488
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,499
I am sorry for your grief, senora.

489
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,332
But I've stood by many graves,
my sadness has dried up.

490
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,957
The army killed your sister.

491
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:17,249
The army, the emeralds, and a man's greed.

492
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,415
(dramatic sombre music continues)

493
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:55,290
- Would you like some water?

494
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:57,665
Hey.

495
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:03,415
You know, it's not against
the rules to cry in here.

496
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,582
It's okay.

497
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,832
(car engine rumbling)

498
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,290
- [Miguel] Hey, Holbrook!

499
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,124
Hi.
- Miguel.

500
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:34,040
- I'm sorry about your sister.

501
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,832
She was a friend and a compatriot.

502
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,665
- Is there anything I can do?

503
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,374
Is there anything you need?

504
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:42,457
- We're on our way back into the hills.

505
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,624
With a jeep, we might
stand a better chance.

506
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,707
- It's yours.

507
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,332
- It's good to have you with us.

508
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,874
(Miguel speaks in Spanish)

509
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:51,874
- You're not really serious

510
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:53,249
about joining up these guys, are you?

511
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,082
- Why not?

512
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,290
- Well, isn't one death enough?

513
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,249
- You don't understand, Wiley.

514
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,165
She believed in their cause.

515
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,332
- Yeah, but you don't.

516
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:01,999
You're just taking her place.

517
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,082
- I'm going up there.

518
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,374
- Hey, friend, where you from?

519
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,207
- New York.

520
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,665
- Yeah, I used to live there myself.

521
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,249
- Well, you never know when
you're gonna run into somebody

522
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,749
from the old neighbourhood.

523
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:14,082
- They didn't have no
blinds in my neighbourhood.

524
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:19,749
(car engine rumbling)

525
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,415
(chicken clucking)

526
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,832
- Where are we going?

527
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,665
- This guy's digging up
emeralds all over his farm,

528
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,290
so we made a little trade.

529
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,582
We pick his coffee beans,
he gives us the emeralds.

530
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,249
- Great deal for the old guy.

531
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,624
- We pick three or four days per emeralds,

532
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,665
in a month, we come
back to pick his coffee,

533
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:51,707
and all we gotta do is get
them down the mountain.

534
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,415
- Without getting our throats cut.

535
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,499
Hey, Lucho.

536
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,332
- [Lucho] Hey, Miguel.

537
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,707
- Come meet some tourists from New York.

538
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,457
They think coffee grows in cups.

539
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:06,540
(Miguel speaks in Spanish)

540
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:07,832
- Please, (Lucho speaks in Spanish).

541
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:14,040
- Tomorrow, we dig for green ice.

542
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,915
(metals clanging)

543
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,499
(Lucho speaks in Spanish)

544
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,249
(dramatic music)

545
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:09,374
(objects clanking)

546
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:15,499
- How much?

547
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,332
- Oh, not the best.

548
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,707
300 a carat maybe.

549
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:21,124
Say, 200 carats.

550
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,374
- 300 a carat.

551
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:23,874
- $60,000

552
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,749
and the old man still wants
to grow his coffee beans.

553
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:29,707
(cicadas chirping)

554
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,415
(Lucho sighs)

555
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,707
(door thuds)

556
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,957
(Lucho speaks in Spanish)

557
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,040
- This is for you.

558
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:38,999
- Ah, no, senor.

559
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,957
You are in my house, no.

560
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,332
- It is the custom of my country,

561
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,624
the taller guy brings the bottle.

562
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:48,124
(Lucho speaks in Spanish)

563
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,540
(Joe sighs)

564
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:51,707
It's so peaceful.

565
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:53,749
- I can hear the...

566
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:54,624
- Cicadas.

567
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:59,040
Cannot you hear the
cicadas in New York, senor?

568
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,915
- In New York, you hear sirens.

569
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:04,915
(Joe sighs)

570
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,249
But here's to emeralds.

571
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,915
- No, senor, I cannot drink to that.

572
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:12,540
They are a curse on my land.

573
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:13,415
- Why?

574
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:15,915
- If the government knew,

575
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:18,832
they would come take away my land,

576
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:21,290
they send me away.

577
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:22,540
It is my father's land.

578
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,832
We grow coffee.

579
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,249
- But with the money,
you could buy more land,

580
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:27,249
grow more coffee.

581
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,665
- More, more.

582
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,290
More is the devil, senor.

583
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,332
- I do not know In your country.

584
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:38,665
In this country, the devil is green.

585
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:42,165
(Lucho speaks in Spanish)

586
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,290
It is not true in your country, senor?

587
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,124
- It is true.

588
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,665
In my country, the devil is green too.

589
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:57,374
(Lucho speaks in Spanish)

590
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,374
What's that?

591
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,374
(Lucho speaks in Spanish)

592
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,457
What do I do with it?

593
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,082
- Feel good?

594
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,957
(Joe exhales)

595
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,957
- But I wanna ask you about your coffee.

596
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,540
How many beans do you get off a tree?

597
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,665
- 2,000.

598
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:34,665
- And how many coffee beans to a pound?

599
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,707
- 2,000, senor.

600
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,874
- So you get one pound
of coffee for every tree.

601
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,582
(Lucho speaks in Spanish)

602
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,499
And where do you sell them?

603
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,707
- I sell him to town.

604
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,165
- You know, in New York
coffee is very expensive.

605
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,374
You could get double
if you exported direct.

606
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:55,874
- But I have no friend in New York, senor.

607
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:58,999
- You do now.

608
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:05,790
(Lucho speaks in Spanish)

609
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,915
- To my friend in New York.

610
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:08,749
(cups clinking)

611
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:12,457
(group speaking in Spanish)

612
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,999

617
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,332
(Joe laughs)

618
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:27,124
(birds chirping)

619
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,665
- Hey, we thought you ran out on us.

620
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:31,707
- No such luck.

621
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,874
- Another five minutes, you
would've missed your ride.

622
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,707
- And all the fun that goes with it.

623
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,249
(car engine revving)

624
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,415
(car engine rumbling)

625
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,832
(man speaks in Spanish)

626
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:29,040
(car engine rumbling)

627
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:33,665
I will stop around the next
curve, then you take over.

628
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,457
(car engine rumbling)

629
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:20,874

(general speaks in Spanish)

632
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,790
- No.

633
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:27,415
(general speaks in Spanish)

634
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:28,874
- Identification.

635
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,665
What are you doing on this road?

636
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:37,082
We got lost.

637
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,790
- Coming from where?

638
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,540
- - We were sight seeing in Lahva.

639
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,082
- What is your destination?

640
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:45,207
- Back to the capital.

641
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:11,374
(guns firing)

642
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,457
- There's enough money here for a general.

643
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,790
His filth.

644
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:38,624
Go.

645
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:39,915
And remember, you've got the emerald.

646
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:42,207
Just get past the next
village and you're okay.

647
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,082
- Let's go, Wiley.

648
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:51,540
(car engine rumbling)

649
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:25,707
- There's the Bogata road.

650
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,874
(car engine rumbling)

651
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,374
(tyres squealing)

652
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:35,915
(metals crashing)

653
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,624
- - Welcome to Barbossa, senor.

654
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,915
- Where's Holbrook?

655
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,707
Where's Holbrook?

656
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,832
You bastards.

657
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:50,665
(Joe groans)

658
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:51,540

(soldiers speaks in Spanish)

665
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,415
Mothers!

666
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:11,832
Where's Holbrook?

667
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,457
(Joe groans)

668
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:18,582
(soldiers speaks in Spanish)

669
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:19,582

(soldier speaks in Spanish)

671
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:26,957
(door thuds)

672
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,540
Shit!

673
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:30,957
(door thuds)

674
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:38,540
(people chattering)

675
00:49:58,708 --> 00:49:59,499
- No.

676
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:00,457
No! No! No!

677
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,874
(man groans)

678
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,207

(car engine revving)

693
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:52,957
- Barbossa is a terrible prison, no?

694
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:56,415
You were fortunate I came when I did.

695
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:57,540
When you go home,

696
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,457
you'll have a good story to tell, huh?

697
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:12,249
(car engine revving)

698
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,582

(car door thuds)

701
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:41,207
(bells ringing)

702
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,915
- I want you to know that I'm
sorry about what's happened.

703
00:52:56,958 --> 00:52:59,624
- I got off lucky compared to my sister.

704
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:01,249
- I should have stopped you from doing it.

705
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,540
- You couldn't have stopped me,

706
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:04,249
no one could have stopped me.

707
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:05,624
I knew what the risks were.

708
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,082
Anyway, we failed.

709
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,374
We have got to come up
with something better.

710
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:11,749
- Like what?
- I don't know.

711
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:12,832
Maybe we could hit the mines

712
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:14,624
before they take the
shipment to the concession.

713
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,790
- After yesterday, they're
gonna be ready and waiting.

714
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,874
- If we could only get our
hands on that helicopter

715
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,040
after it leaves the mine.

716
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:21,540
- Why are we settling
for one little shipment?

717
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:23,540
Why don't you just break
into Argenti's sky vault

718
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,832
and take it all?

719
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:27,165
- Oh, if we only could.

720
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,915
- Yeah, we could.

721
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,790
We could if we're a pair of lunatics.

722
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,165
(crowd chattering)

723
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:45,707
- All right, let's hear it.

724
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,582
- We've got a plan to rob the concession.

725
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:53,707
- The concession?

726
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,665
You're crazy, we wouldn't
get past the lobby.

727
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:58,499
- We don't have to, my plan
starts on the top floor.

728
00:53:58,541 --> 00:53:59,832
- What's he talking about?

729
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:03,790
- What if I told you that
Wiley can put us on the roof?

730
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:05,249
- Does he know how to fly?

731
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,124
- No, but I got a friend who does.

732
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:10,040
(airplane roaring)

733
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:21,582
- Senor Claude?

734
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,415
- Aye, I'm Claude.

735
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:23,874
You must be Tomas.

736
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:24,915
- Yes. Can I take your bike?

737
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,290
- Oh, no, no, no, I
always carry my own bag,

738
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:28,290
but you can get off Wiley's.

739
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,124
- (speaks in Spanish), senor.

740
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,665
- Put your words right out
of my mouth, old buddy.

741
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:39,832
- I have kept it hidden for eight years.

742
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:41,832
Even you didn't know.

743
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:42,999
- I don't want to know.

744
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:45,499
They let you live.

745
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,624
You are a king here.

746
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:48,832
- A king in exile

747
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:52,040
but from my native country.

748
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,040
You will make a ring for me with emeralds,

749
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,790
but with a diamond at the core,

750
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:02,749
a wedding ring.

751
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,290
It'll be the last piece
you will make for me

752
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:08,749
in this godforsaken land.

753
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:12,832
- You really believe the diamond
concession will forgive you

754
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,249
when you are married to her?

755
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:17,832
- Her father would make sure that they do.

756
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,165
- Meno, you underestimate them.

757
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,457
They do not forget so easily.

758
00:55:27,416 --> 00:55:28,332
- We will see.

759
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,540
(helicopter whirring)

760
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:11,749
(helicopter rumbling)

761
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,082
- What do you think?

762
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:22,707
- It's a whole lot better
than the beansprouts.

763
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:25,040
- It better be they got
pigs here instead of rats.

764
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:26,749
Can you get us up there?

765
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:28,540
- Sure.
- How sure?

766
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:29,374
- 80-20.

767
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:32,124
I can get us up there if you
can take care of the pigs.

768
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:32,957
- All but one.

769
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:35,332
- And he's yours.

770
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:37,749
All you gotta do is get
him to say his name.

771
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:38,999
- You like it?

772
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,040
- I love it.

773
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:45,790
(bright playful music)

774
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,124
- Very nice.

775
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,499
How much do I owe you?

776
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,040
- Hmm. Only 2,000.

777
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:14,124
It was a very short game.

778
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:15,832
- But a sweet experience.

779
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,290
How would you like it?

780
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:19,790
- Cash would do nicely.

781
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:22,124
- Cash you shall have for shopping.

782
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,624
I want you to look exceptionally
elegant this evening

783
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:26,665
for a reception

784
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,957
- This evening?

785
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,040
- To introduce my future wife.

786
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,165
- You don't look happy.

787
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:41,082
- No, I was just a little
surprised, that's all.

788
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:46,207
On second thought, I
would rather have a check.

789
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,040
- Why?

790
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:49,374
- Well, so I can say it
was written by the hand

791
00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:51,374
of Meno S. Argenti.

792
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:54,332
What does the S stand for?

793
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:55,207
Salvatore?

794
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,165
- Sebastiano.

795
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,457
- Meno Sebastian Argenti.

796
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,249
- Meno Sebastiano Argenti.

797
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,832
(ominous music)

798
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:22,207
(crown chattering)

799
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,749
(switch clicking)

800
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,665
(machine whirring)

801
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,457
(case thumping)

802
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,415
(machine whirring)

803
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,082
(baggage thudding)

804
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,290
- Am I going somewhere?

805
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:09,457
Soon?

806
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:14,332
(sighs) Now?

807
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:19,082
(footsteps thumping)

808
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:21,874
(birds chirping)

809
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:24,124
What the hell is going on?

810
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,790
- I would've thought it obvious.

811
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,165
The holiday's over.

812
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:30,415
You're on a direct flight
to New York this evening.

813
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:32,290
- And what if I'm not ready to go?

814
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:35,124
- Then Herado would be happy to help you.

815
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:36,499
You'll find in your suitcase

816
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,957
a substantial sum for what you did.

817
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,624
- How much?

818
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:41,915
- More than you're worth, Mr. Wiley.

819
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:42,790
$1,000.

820
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,290
- Yeah. Well I think I'm worth $10,000.

821
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:49,374
- 10,000? For what?

822
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,540
- For finding the flaw in your system.

823
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,332
- The flaw. Impossible.

824
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:54,457
- See for yourself.

825
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:58,707
- What's all this?

826
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,957
- There's a miscalculation
in your electronic system.

827
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,832
Whoever made out that equation
should go back to school.

828
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:06,124
I could break into your
building blindfolded.

829
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:08,249
- Prove it.

830
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:10,874
- How much time have I got?

831
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:16,582
- 24 hours, Mr. Wiley.

832
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:19,374
(dramatic music)

833
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:28,499
(air whooshing)

834
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,415
- Now remember,

835
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:31,582
left hand, warm her up, up you go.

836
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:32,749
Right hand, down you come.

837
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,040
Left hand up, right hand down.

838
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:34,874
You got it?
- Yeah.

839
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:36,832
- Good. You nervous?
- No, scared shitless.

840
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,290
- Just hold onto this.
- Alright.

841
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,582
(air whooshing)

842
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:43,999
All right, now did you get that?

843
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,415
Warm her up (air whooshing),

844
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:46,665
down you go.

845
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:47,540
- Yeah.

846
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:48,415
You take out insurance?

847
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,249
(Claude laughs)

848
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,582
- I got a feeling you don't like heights.

849
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:52,082
- I can't swim too good either, cowboy.

850
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:53,749
What else is new?
- I tell you what?

851
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,790
You just hang onto to your butt

852
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:56,165
and Claude's cloud
hoppers will get you there

853
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:57,457
sitting down all the way.

854
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:03,082
(air whooshing)

855
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:04,499
- Let's fly.

856
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:08,499
(air whooshing)

857
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,957
- Jesus, I'm already going the wrong way.

858
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,332
(soothing upbeat music)

859
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,165
Hey, somebody move that tree!

860
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,165
(air whooshing)

861
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:38,957
- Whoa.

862
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,040

876

- Don't waste gas otherwise
you will be walking.

877
01:02:41,708 --> 01:02:45,040
(soothing upbeat music)

878
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:52,457
(alluring romantic music)

879
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,874
- Where is everybody?

880
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:56,040
- The guests haven't arrived yet.

881
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:58,124
You might say that we are a little early.

882
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,290
I invited them all for tomorrow.

883
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,249
The night is just for you and me.

884
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:06,082
- Meno, don't play games.

885
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:07,874
What is tonight really about?

886
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:09,124
(Meno chuckles)

887
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:12,124
- I merely wanted to show
you what would be yours

888
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:13,290
when you marry me.

889
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,290
- I haven't said I'd marry you.

890
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:17,582
- But you must.

891
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,457
- Why, Meno? Why must I?

892
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,832
(alluring romantic music continues)

893
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:29,665
- Have you seen one of these before?

894
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,165
- Yes, of course.

895
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,415
- Your father wears it.

896
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:35,707
It's the insignia of
a very exclusive club,

897
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,707
the International Diamond concession.

898
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,749
I'm forbidden to wear it now.

899
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:42,624
- Why?

900
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:46,499
- There was a theft

901
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:49,915
of some 10 million
dollars worth of diamonds.

902
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:52,915
I didn't steal them.

903
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,582
I was an honest, trusted dealer.

904
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,332
But I bought them secretly.

905
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:03,082
And then little by little, I sold them.

906
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:06,665
Inevitably, I was caught
by the diamond concession.

907
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:10,540
The penalty is usually death.

908
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:12,415
Fortunately, I was well-connected.

909
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:16,457
They offered me a rather firm exchange,

910
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,874
my life for a one way
passage to South America.

911
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,290
I could continue to live

912
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:28,082
as long as I never set foot
outside this continent.

913
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:29,707
- But how would they ever know?

914
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:35,540
- Have you ever had the impression

915
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,165
that you are being watched?

916
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,582
It's something I've learned to live with

917
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:43,874
ever since I came here.

918
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:47,374
Perhaps I'm mistaken.

919
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:52,124
Unfortunately, there's only
one way to know for sure.

920
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:55,582
Therefore, I'm offering...

921
01:04:58,625 --> 01:04:59,540
a marriage.

922
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:06,082
- A union of diamonds and emeralds.

923
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:18,082
- And with my father's connections,

924
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:19,957
you would be allowed to leave.

925
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,749
- Not simply to leave,

926
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,332
but to return home.

927
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:28,290
- I understand.

928
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,332
- You see, I could have lied to you.

929
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:33,915
Of course, you could live your life

930
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:36,540
without too much interference from me.

931
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:38,874
We could allow playthings.

932
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:41,207
Like Mr. Wiley, for instance.

933
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:43,874
But for the concession,

934
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,915
we would be husband and wife.

935
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:52,874
- Do you know that your soldiers
have killed many people?

936
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:57,082
Have you ever seen the dead
lying in the mountains?

937
01:05:57,125 --> 01:06:00,124
- Just rebels and things.

938
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,290
- And my sister?

939
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,540
- She consorted with scum.

940
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:08,374
- And that was reason to kill her?

941
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,415
- She killed herself.

942
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:17,124
If it wasn't here and now,

943
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:19,082
it would've been tomorrow
in some other country

944
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:21,082
for some other ridiculous cause.

945
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:26,790
I must have your answer, please.

946
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,874
- In the morning, Meno.

947
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:30,707
Goodnight.

948

1011
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:03,040
Miguel.

1012
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,582
Hold the case up to your shoulder.

1013
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:24,249
- Okay, Miguel, a little forward.

1014
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,082
A little more.

1015
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:27,665
A little more.

1016
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:28,957
That's it.

1017
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,832
Hold it there.

1018
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:37,957
(machine whirring)

1019
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:41,832
- Hey, who invited him?

1020
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:46,165
Meathead, how do you like it in there?

1021
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:47,082
Can you talk?

1022
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:48,874
- He will.

1023
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:51,124
(switch clicking)

1024
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:51,957
I hope.

1025
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:57,290
- Meno Sebastiano Argenti.

1028
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,124
Now, wait a minute.

1029
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:11,040
We came in,

1030
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,165
I went to the window,

1031
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:16,165
he stood here...

1032
01:15:16,166 --> 01:15:16,999
About there.

1033
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,874
Come forward.

1034
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:25,082
Forward, forward, hold it.

1035
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:26,582
Hold it right there.

(machine whirring)

1041
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,457
- Meno Sebastiano Argenti.

01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:02,999

(dramatic suspenseful music)

1048
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:29,457
- It is magic.

(dramatic mystifying music)

1050
01:16:34,666 --> 01:16:36,915
We just hijacked an empire.

(dramatic mystifying music continues)

1052
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:01,540
- Okay, enough.

1053
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,374
- How much we got?

1054
01:17:02,416 --> 01:17:03,207
50 million?

1055
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,082
- More like 100.

1056
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:05,124
- Hey, I like you.

1057
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,040
You come through first.

1058
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:06,874
What about you guys?

1059
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:07,915
A few mobile homes, huh?

1060
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:08,957
Let's go.
- Mobile homes nothing.

1061
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,207
That's Peace Corps talk.

1062
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:15,540
(suspenseful music)

1063
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:40,415
- Where the hell are your guys?

1064
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:43,707
- Relax, the ball games over, we won.

1065
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:44,540
- The hell we have.

1066
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:45,582
We just emptied a man's bag.

1067
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:46,540
You think he's gonna lay around

1068
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,999
and chalk it up to one for the cause?

1069
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:48,957
- He's finished, man.

1070
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,749
It's only a matter of
time before he goes down,

1071
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,457
and bang, we get our country back.

1072
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,915
All my life, I fought for this change,

1073
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,832
and now I'm gonna see it with my own eyes.

1074
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,165
- I hate to disappoint you, Miguel,

1075
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:58,582
but there are a hundred Argentis out there

1076
01:17:58,583 --> 01:17:59,749
just waiting their turn.

1077
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:00,832
Just because you knock over one

1078
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:02,665
doesn't mean another one's
not gonna pop up tomorrow.

1079
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:04,874
- A hundred Miguels can
pop up tomorrow too.

1080
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:07,040
- Hey, you don't get it,

1081
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:08,749
do you (speaks in Spanish)?

1082
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,915
There's a network out there
full of people like me

1083
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:11,999
and my brothers and sisters

1084
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:13,290
starting fires all over the world.

1085
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:14,332
It's global, man.

1086
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:15,957
And me and you will go
down as Robin Hoods.

1087
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,832
- Robin Hood?

1088
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:17,665
He stole from the rich.

1089
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:19,582
He didn't blow up airports,
he didn't kill hostages.

1090
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:20,415
- Same, man.

1091
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:21,832
Today's a whole different strategy.

1092
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:24,040
Sometimes you gotta do things
you don't like for the cause.

1093
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:26,874
- Well, just remember, Miguel,
we got different causes.

1094
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:29,790
(engine rumbling)

1095
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,124
Here comes the cavalry.

1096
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:32,082
You want to jump first?

1097
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:33,207
- I don't wanna jump at all.

1098
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,082
(engine rumbling)

1099
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,415
- All right, keep the line taut.

1100
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:43,582
And pray.

1101
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:45,374
Hard.

1102
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:50,040
(metals clinking)

1103
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,999
(truck thuds)

1104
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:27,040
(person speaking Spanish)

1105
01:19:57,791 --> 01:20:00,457
(Miguel groans)

1106
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,915
(dramatic ominous music)

1107
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:26,082
(person speaking Spanish)

1108
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:29,582
- Go.

1109
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:32,082
Go.

1110
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:35,624
(person speaking Spanish)

1111
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:41,249
(engine rumbling)

1112
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:18,665
(air whistling)

1113
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:22,040
(engine rumbling)

1114
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,915
(bag thuds)

1115
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:24,749
- Where's Miguel?

1116
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,999
- He didn't make it.

1117
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,124
We're going back for him.

1118
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:27,957
- He said go.

1119
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:29,207
- Now, come on, let's
get the hell outta here

1120
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,332
or we'll all end up back in that pig farm.

1121
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:35,124
(car door thuds)
Let's go.

1122
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:38,207
(tense sombre music)

1123
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:06,999
(suspenseful upbeat music)

1124
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:20,749
(helicopter rumbling)

1125
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:34,582
(suspenseful upbeat music continues)

1126
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:41,832
(helicopter rumbling)

1127
01:23:22,041 --> 01:23:23,124
- It's too late.

1128
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:24,540
It's over.

1129
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,040
You've been living off
the people for too long,

1130
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:28,249
and tonight it ended.

1131
01:23:28,291 --> 01:23:29,790
It's finished for your guys.

1132
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:30,665
- What is he talking about?

1133
01:23:30,666 --> 01:23:32,874
- Go look in your vault.

1134
01:23:32,916 --> 01:23:35,249
We took back what you stole.

1135
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:36,290
- Get him up!

1136
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:40,749
(suspenseful upbeat music continues)

1137
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:57,207
(object creaking)

1138
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:08,915
I regret that me you will
not take to Barbossa.

1139
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:11,582
(object creaking)

1140
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:14,040
(rope snaps)

1141
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,082
(Miguel thuds)

1142
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:27,957
(glass containers shattering)

1143
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:32,832
- It was the girl.

1144
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:34,040
- No, it was you.

1145
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:35,415
You let them rob me.

1146
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:36,665
- It was the girl, I have proof.

1147
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:37,957
- You are mad.

1148
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:39,082
You know nothing.

1149
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:40,457
- All the time you've spent with the girl,

1150
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,040
she was working to destroy you.

1151
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:45,957
Face the truth where she is concerned.

1152
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,332
(object thumping)

1153
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:07,165
(picture frame shatters)

1154
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,957
(dramatic music)

1155
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:29,915
(car door groaning)

1156
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:34,665
(dramatic suspenseful music)

1157
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:43,290
- You sure this is the right place?

1158
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:45,457
- Miguel said this is
where they'd find us.

1159
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:51,499
(dramatic suspenseful music continues)

1160
01:25:57,916 --> 01:25:58,957
- Trouble.

1161
01:25:58,958 --> 01:26:00,165
- Americano?

1162
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:02,124
- Canadians actually.

1163
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:03,290
- Where are you going?

1164
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:04,165
- Fishing.

1165
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,040
Look out, those are fish hooks,

1166
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:08,290
you could stick yourself.

1167
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:13,915
- We are with Miguel.

1168
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:16,540
He's dead.

1169
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:19,165
You come with me.

1170
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:31,290
I am going to give you
the best boat we've got.

1171
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:32,832
But you'd better take it now

1172
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:35,707
before the Yankees who own
it get back from sightseeing.

1173
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:36,540
- Don't you think

1174
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:38,457
we ought to turn the
emeralds over to them?

1175
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,790
- No, you hand them the stones,

1176
01:26:39,791 --> 01:26:42,082
you hand them their death warrant.

1177
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:45,290
(lively upbeat music)

1178
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:24,165
- Well, feeling any richer?

1179
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:26,249
- They're not ours, Wiley.

1180
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:28,332
- Well, what are we going to do?

1181
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:30,499
- We're gonna deliver them
the way Miguel wanted.

1182
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,457
(Joe exhales deeply)

1183
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,249
- What? In care of the revolution?

1184
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,874
What's our address?

1185
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:35,915
Maybe we should just mail one

1186
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:38,082
to every family in the country.

1187
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:39,207
- If there's something on your mind,

1188
01:27:39,208 --> 01:27:41,124
why don't you just say it?

1189
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:43,665
- Why should anything be on my mind?

1190
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:44,665
I mean, I just risked my life

1191
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:46,374
for something that doesn't belong to me.

1192
01:27:46,416 --> 01:27:48,082
Now I'm riding in a stolen boat

1193
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:49,499
with someone who hasn't
even got the courtesy

1194
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:50,957
to tell me where we're going.

1195
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:55,082
- My family has a beach house in the Keys.

1196
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:59,749
(ominous music)

1197
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,124
- They know we're coming?

1198
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:03,082
- There's seldom anyone there.

1199
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:04,290
- Well, that's good.

1200
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:06,832
Then they won't mind if
we don't show for dinner.

1201
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:08,040
Here come the Marines.

1202
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:12,290
(alarms bleating)

1203
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:15,332
I'll see you on the pig farm.

1204
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:21,832
- [Lieutenant] Mae
West, stop your engines.

1205
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,499
We're coming aboard.

1206
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:28,707
- Mr. and Mrs. Goldenheimer,
you're American?

1207
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:29,832
- That's right.

1208
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:31,332
- You're registered out of Miami.

1209
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:32,207
- Right.

1210
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,415
- You're going back to Miami?

1211
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:34,249
- We're trying.

1212
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:37,332
- It's a long way.

1213
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,124
- It's home.

1214
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,707
(lieutenant speaks in Spanish)

1215
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:45,957
- Forgive me, senora,
you have to be patient.

1216
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:46,874
We have much trouble

1217
01:28:46,875 --> 01:28:50,207
with the marimberos running
marijuana to your country.

1218
01:28:50,208 --> 01:28:51,749
- A beer, lieutenant?

1219
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:56,749
- No, (speaks in Spanish).

1220
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:07,457
(glass bottles clanking)

1221
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,915
(door thuds)

1222
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:33,749
(officer speaks in Spanish)

1223
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:37,415
(lieutenant speaks in Spanish)

1224
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:39,624
(officer speaks in Spanish)

1225
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:41,707
Why do you bring guns
on a pleasure cruise?

1226
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:44,540
- Well, these are dangerous
waters, lieutenant.

1227
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:45,582
- Perhaps.

1228
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:47,832
- Would you bring your
wife out here unarmed?

1229
01:29:53,958 --> 01:29:57,124
- No, I wouldn't.

1230
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:17,957
What is this?

1231
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:20,040
- That's a bait well.

1232
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:24,874
- This is bait for commercial fishing.

1233
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:25,999
Do you have a license?

1234
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:28,207
- Well, it all came with a boat.

1235
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:29,124
- It is illegal.

1236
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,832
For you, it's a sport.

1237
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:34,665
For our fishermen, it is their living.

1238
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:35,957
There is a heavy fine.

1239
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:40,624
(water splashing)

1240
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:47,082
(gentle serene music)

1241
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:03,165
This time, I'll let
you off with a warning.

1242
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,582
Senor.

1243
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:05,915
Senora.

1244
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:09,249
(dramatic sombre music)

1245
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:12,415
(lieutenant speaks in Spanish)

1246
01:31:12,458 --> 01:31:15,290
(engine rumbling)

1247
01:31:16,958 --> 01:31:19,040
- Ah, I don't believe it.

1248
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,874
- Unfortunately, no one else will either.

1249
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:27,082
- All for nothing.

1250
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:28,124
(waves crashing)

1251
01:31:28,166 --> 01:31:32,332
(dramatic sombre music continues)

1252
01:31:41,833 --> 01:31:45,582
(dramatic suspenseful music)

1253
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:25,499
(glass shattering)

1254
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:35,665
Smells a bit musty.

1255
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:37,790
- Open the windows.

1256
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:40,665
- Anything you say, Princess.

1257
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:43,457
- Nobody uses the place much anymore.

1258
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,415
Oh, this house brings back memories.

1259
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:48,832
- Happy ones?

1260
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:49,790
- Well, it's the only time

1261
01:32:49,833 --> 01:32:51,957
we ever acted very much like a family.

1262
01:32:59,208 --> 01:33:01,874
(cabinet thuds)

1263
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,790
- Oh, the phone's dead.

1264
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:13,207
- You expecting a call?

1265
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,582
There's not much to eat.

1266
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:20,540
- I'm not hungry.

1267
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:23,624
Who's that?

1268
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:28,457
- The postman checking the
mailbox of an empty house?

1269
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,749
- Stop being paranoid.

1270
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:50,415
- Does Argenti know about this place?

1271
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,124
- What do you think?

1272
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,165
- That's what I thought.

1273
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:03,290
- How far away is the nearest neighbour?

1274
01:34:03,333 --> 01:34:05,957
- The local store is
about a half mile away.

1275
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:07,165
- Yeah, well, you got a bullhorn

1276
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:08,874
in case we gotta yell for help?

1277
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:20,874
What are you doing?

1278
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,374
- I thought I'd play some music.

1279
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:23,624
- Oh, that's just what we need.

1280
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:24,624
We ought to give a party

1281
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:26,582
and tell everybody we're back in town.

1282
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:29,040
Mussolini as men could be
here any minute, you know?

1283
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:30,082
- Relax.

1284
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:31,332
- I don't wanna stand around here

1285
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:32,165
and wait for these people to get here.

1286
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:35,582
- Well, you are the ideas man,
you come up with something.

1287
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:37,790
In the meantime, I'm
gonna go get some food.

1288
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:41,082
You need anything?

1289
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:43,540
- Yeah, I'd like a
Phillips head screwdriver,

1290
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:46,582
some double-sided tape,
and a soldering iron.

1291
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:53,415
(door thuds)

1292
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:59,165
(footsteps thumping)

1293
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:11,874
- What are you doing?

1294
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,457
- Oh, I think I figured out a way

1295
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:18,957
to protect this place and maybe ourselves.

1296
01:35:20,791 --> 01:35:21,874
- I miss you.

1297
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:22,749
- Really?

1298
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,915
- I'm getting used to having you around.

1299
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:25,915
- That's gonna be a problem

1300
01:35:25,958 --> 01:35:28,540
if your friend Argenti has
anything to say about it.

1301
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:32,332
- Let's just forget him, shall we?

1302
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:33,249
- Oh, I'd love to.

1303
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:35,915
(object thuds)

1304
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:36,749
What was that?

1305
01:35:39,625 --> 01:35:40,457
- Wiley.

1306
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:42,915
Come on.

1307
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:47,290
- Oh, I, I think one of
us ought to stay awake.

1308
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:48,832
- Well, I have a better idea.

1309
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:50,957
Why don't we both stay awake together?

1310
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:55,082
- I, I don't think that,

1311
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:55,999
that that's practical.

1312
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:58,749
- No, but it could be enjoyable.

1313
01:36:03,208 --> 01:36:06,540
(romantic sultry music)

1314
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:15,332
- How can you think of
that at a time like this?

1315
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:18,915
- It could be our last night together.

1316
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:23,124
(romantic sultry music continues)

1317
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:03,457
(door thumping)

1318
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,957
(alarm beeps)

1319
01:37:22,083 --> 01:37:25,415
(lively cheerful music)

1320
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:34,415
(alarm blaring)

1321
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:39,457
- The kitchen, find the fuse box.

1322
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:42,957
(alarm blaring continues)

1323
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:51,790
(fuse box fizzles)
(person screaming)

1324
01:37:51,791 --> 01:37:54,540
(Liliana groans)

1325
01:37:57,916 --> 01:38:00,957
(footsteps thumping)

1326
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:03,624
- Holbrook we've gotta
get the hell out of here.

1327
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:04,499
This is madness.

1328
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:10,249
- Wiley.
- What?

1329
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:11,332
- In case we don't make it,

1330
01:38:11,333 --> 01:38:12,499
- Oh, don't even mention that.

1331
01:38:12,541 --> 01:38:13,832
- I just want you to know,

1332
01:38:13,875 --> 01:38:14,874
what happened last night-

1333
01:38:14,916 --> 01:38:16,874
- This is not the time.

1334
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:17,749
- Was incredible.

1335
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:21,457
- Come on.

1336
01:38:22,666 --> 01:38:24,624
- [Joe] Let's call a
taxi and head for Miami.

1337
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:25,499
Get the first plane to New York.

1338
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,332
(guns firing)

1339
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:29,332
(voice-over warping)

1340
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:35,249
(gun firing)

1341
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:40,165
- I am gonna head for the beach
and try and draw their fire.

1342
01:38:40,208 --> 01:38:42,374
You, find some cover for yourself.

1343
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:43,207
Go!

1344
01:38:45,166 --> 01:38:46,457
(tense suspenseful music)

1345
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:47,665
- [Meno] Kellerman, have you found them?

1346
01:38:48,791 --> 01:38:50,665
- Everything is proceeding as planned.

1347
01:38:50,666 --> 01:38:51,874
- [Meno] Don't tell the girl.

1348
01:38:51,916 --> 01:38:52,957
- She's still alive.

1349
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,290
- [Meno] I'm coming ashore.

1350
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:55,582
- That is not wise.

1351
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:58,415
- [Meno] Even the diamond
concession would understand.

1352
01:38:58,458 --> 01:39:00,374
Kellerman, wait for me.

1353
01:39:01,375 --> 01:39:04,582
(guns firing)

1354
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:08,374
(dramatic suspenseful music)

1355
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:21,374
(guns firing)

1356
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:24,832
(gun firing)

1357
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:29,415
(dramatic suspenseful music continues)

1358
01:39:43,583 --> 01:39:44,374
(gun clicks)

1359
01:39:44,416 --> 01:39:48,957
(dramatic suspenseful music continues)

1360
01:39:51,666 --> 01:39:52,540
(gun clicks)

1361
01:39:52,583 --> 01:39:57,165
(dramatic suspenseful music continues)

1362
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:02,957
(fists thumping)

1363
01:40:02,958 --> 01:40:04,540
(Herado grunts)

1364
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:06,707
(Joe groans)

1365
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:10,457
(suspenseful music)

1366
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:12,874
(Joe groans)

1367
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:15,665
(fist thumping)

1368
01:40:15,708 --> 01:40:16,874
(Joe groans)

1369
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:17,707
(suspenseful music continues)

1370
01:40:17,708 --> 01:40:19,415
(Joe groans)

1371
01:40:19,458 --> 01:40:23,290
(suspenseful music continues)

1372
01:40:36,083 --> 01:40:38,499
(Joe groans)

1373
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:47,957
(plank cracking)

1374
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:52,082

1377
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:24,707
(suspenseful music continues)

1378
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:33,665
- Dear God.

1379
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:57,040
(footsteps thumping)

1380
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:06,249
(door thumping)

1381
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:10,040
(couch thuds)

1382
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:30,499
(dramatic sombre music)

1383
01:42:50,458 --> 01:42:53,124
(Liliana moans)

1384
01:42:59,166 --> 01:42:59,957
(Liliana sighs)

1385
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:00,790
(Liliana groan)

1386
01:43:00,833 --> 01:43:01,915
Hello, Wiley.

1387
01:43:04,833 --> 01:43:05,624
(Liliana groans)

1388
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:09,832
(dramatic sombre music continues)

1389
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:15,290
(Liliana groans)

1390
01:43:19,625 --> 01:43:20,457
- A dart.

1391
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:23,790
Argenti wanted me alive.

1392
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:25,749
- Can we get out of this fantasy land now

1393
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:27,749
and get back to reality, please?

1394
01:43:29,958 --> 01:43:31,249
(door creaks)

1395
01:43:31,291 --> 01:43:34,540
(sombre ominous music)

1396
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,290
- Not quite yet, Mr. Wiley.

1397
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:39,915
Not until you return every single stone.

1398
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:42,790
- Well, we're gonna

1399
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:45,082
need a little deep sea
diving equipment for that.

1400
01:43:45,125 --> 01:43:46,999
- Liliana, you know me well.

1401
01:43:47,041 --> 01:43:49,332
- Impress upon Mr. Wiley
that in times like this,

1402
01:43:49,375 --> 01:43:50,624
it is best not-

1403
01:43:50,625 --> 01:43:55,040
(dramatic foreboding music)

1404
01:43:55,083 --> 01:43:55,915
You?

1405
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:00,707
The concession?

1406
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:04,540
All these years,

1407
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:06,957
you were the one I trusted.

1408
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,415
(gun firing)

1409
01:44:11,333 --> 01:44:12,124
(gun clatters)

1410
01:44:12,166 --> 01:44:14,582
(body thuds)

1411
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:25,832
- I warned you, Meno,

1412
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:27,124
so many times.

1413
01:44:27,166 --> 01:44:29,915
(waves crashing)

1414
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:34,207
(footsteps thumping)

1415
01:44:41,083 --> 01:44:44,582
(upbeat electronic music)

1416
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:16,957
- Wiley, what exactly are we doing

1417
01:45:16,958 --> 01:45:18,540
down on the Brooklyn docks?

1418
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:21,207
- I got a little business to take care of.

1419
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:23,832
It shouldn't take me
more than a few minutes.

1420
01:45:23,833 --> 01:45:25,290
- It's not another gimmick.

1421
01:45:27,208 --> 01:45:28,707
(car door thuds)

1422
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:31,665
(machine whirring)

1423
01:45:35,416 --> 01:45:38,165
(sirens blaring)

1424
01:45:46,958 --> 01:45:49,290
- This is just a sample consignment.

1425
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:52,249
I should be receiving monthly
shipments from now on.

1426
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:55,082
Well, be sure to check with me next time.

1427
01:45:55,125 --> 01:45:56,415
Ask for Linda, all right?

1428
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:58,915
(engine rumbles)

1429
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:01,707
(sirens blaring)

1430
01:46:12,166 --> 01:46:15,665
(coffee beans clattering)

1431
01:46:29,958 --> 01:46:32,707
(dramatic music)

1432
01:46:45,541 --> 01:46:49,040
(coffee beans clattering)

1433
01:46:52,375 --> 01:46:53,165
(trunk thuds)

1434
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:55,165
- What were you doing, counting beans?

1435
01:46:58,541 --> 01:47:00,457
You'll never learn will you, Wiley?

1436
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:03,124
- No, I guess I'll never learn.

1437
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:05,957
