If you don't want me here,
why don't you just fire me?

Because I can't fire you.

you don't have the balls to fire me.

who can handle the job.

-He said, talk to you.

then maybe his membership would accept.

Right.

56
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,191
What that means is,
his guys walk for two weeks

57

till I kiss their ass
and hand them all kinds of concessions.

58
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,407
Then maybe, maybe
they'll take in a handful of your people.

You're saying no.

64
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,545
Maybe some other job, all right?

65

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,779
They do it all the time.

174
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,907
They are nepotistic sleazebags, remember?

175
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,159
[sighs]

176
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,162
Wynn, he's a Black man.
He lives in your district.

177
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,496
He's had some bad breaks...

178
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,332
Grand theft is not a bad break.
Drop me off here.

179
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,260
Look, I promise that
if something comes up for him,

180
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,846
I'll do the best I can, okay?

181
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,932
-That's all I'm asking.
-Okay.

182
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,436
Hang tough.

183
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,688
-Yeah, you too, baby.
-[laughs]

184
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,359
[sighs]

185
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,322
[man] "Mad Anthony again,
the lowest man in town.

186
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,157
This time I've really
gone off the deep end.

187
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,826
Everything, and I mean everything
on our shelves

188
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,496
has been marked down
to rock-bottom prices.

189
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,749
All your electronic
and computer-age needs under one roof..."

190
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,628
We're here every day.

191
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,338
We see what happens here.

192
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,714
It's the Spanish.

193
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,841
It hasn't been the same
since they showed up.

194
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,011
They make this noise with their teeth,
this sucking noise.

195
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,306
I was raised on this block.
Now I wouldn't walk here alone.

196
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,767
I'm a married woman with children.
Means nothing to them.

197
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,519
And these people out on the street.

198
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,230
You walk out your door,
it's a friggin' lunatic asylum.

199
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,566
Needles in the sandboxes in the park.
These crack vials.

200
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,611
No respect. No sense of responsibility.

201
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,697
It's the welfare. Why work?
The government takes care of you.

202
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,951
I used to feel bad for the kids,
but they're the worst.

203
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,869
Thirteen years old
with a baby on their hip.

204
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,831
-Do you ladies have a complaint?
-Complaint? Have you been listening?

205
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,541
A specific complaint.

206
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,334
A criminal charge.

207
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,169
See, Connie? They don't care.

208
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,212
They don't care.

209
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,714
You gotta be gang-raped
and roasted at the stake

210
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,049
before they'll lift a finger.

211
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,051
If it was your kids
out here on this street,

212
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,096
you wouldn't be sitting on your ass,
doing nothing.

213
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,683
[Joann] Look at this.
There's your tax money, right there.

214
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,851
[Connie] Why do we bother?

215
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,145
Jesus fucking Christ.

216
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,314
In stereo.
The skinny one's like my mother's cousin.

217
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,649
A bitch on wheels.

218
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,486
They got a point maybe,
but it ain't our fault.

219
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,197
I'm gonna drive by DeLillo's.

220
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,199
-Will you quit with that? It's over.
-Never.

221
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,701
I'm not giving up on it, all right?

222
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,248
Just what I need. O'Brien.

223
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,710
Morning, fellas.

224
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,878
Bill.

225
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,255
You going to the mayor's dinner
on Friday night?

226
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,674
What, a hundred bucks a pop? Forget it.

227
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,093
But I'll see you there, won't I, Mike? Ah.

228
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,804
Now, take these, push them around
to people on your beat.

229
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,223
You make that kid Ramirez,
you run him in.

230
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,683
We ran him in yesterday.

231
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,185
-Bring him in again.
-What for?

232
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,562
Suspicion of being on my shit list.

233
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,772
Make it a priority, Tommy.

234
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,941
Oh, have a good one.

235
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,657
-What's your problem with O'Brien?
-He's an asswipe.

236
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:41,575
So?

237
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,203
So he ain't a detective.
He's a fucking politician.

238
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,163
Everybody's a politician.

239
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,706
Yeah? I'm not.

240
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,334
Why do you think
I'm still in uniform at my age?

241
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,752
Because you're stupid.

242
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,715
Right. Because I don't kick back
to the pols every time I turn around.

243
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,301
A hundred bucks a pop. Christ.

244
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,304
Wonder if she's working today.

245
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,765
Hey, forget about her, kid. She's history.

246
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,061
[Bobby]
Maybe you should start small, Nick.

247
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,396
Open up a lunch wagon next to Stavros.

248
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,440
Yeah, Nicky's Food-O-Rama. [snickers]

249
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,610
Restaurant's gotta have personality.

250
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,570
And very hot waitresses.

251
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,323
Yeah, that can be part of it.

252
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,492
I'm sorry I'm late. I had a class.

253
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,826
You got Tables 6 and 9.

254
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,995
-I started them for you.
-All right.

255
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,580
Good seeing you folks again.

256
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,791
I'm sure Larry can iron out
all the details with you.

257
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,709
-Take it easy, Alex.
-Take care.

258
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,629
-I'll send your waitress right over.
-[Zimmer] Thanks, doll.

259
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,467
So, what are these details?

260
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,135
He talked about racquetball.

261
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,763
The district attorney
would be happy to have your backing,

262
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,766
but we need to get more specific
about the parameters.

263
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,935
We're discussing certain properties
on L Street.

264
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,770
I recall the previous conversation.

265
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,190
L Street has to come down
for Galaxy Towers to go up.

266
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,486
If those buildings aren't clear in a week,
the New York money walks,

267
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,072
the Japanese walk,
the whole thing falls apart.

268
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,324
If we get past that,
we'll need major juice

269
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,411
on the development package
when it comes up at council.

270
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,206
He's the district attorney, fellas.
This stuff's all municipal.

271
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,625
Who's municipal?
This comes down from Baci.

272
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,253
The second-most indictable mayor
in the state.

273
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,422
You must have a file like a phone book
on the guy.

274
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,133
The district attorney is very concerned
about municipal corruption,

275
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,552
but to take on a machine like Baci's...

276
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,347
I'm just not sure
what the incentive would be.

277
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,948
If your man tries
for the Senate next year,

278
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,825
he'll need a lot of resources.

279
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,454
Any effort on his part
to improve the climate in this city...

280
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,798
We're moving mountains here, fellas,
and you give me a week.

281
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,052
But we're always interested
in support from the business sector.

282
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,101
I think you can count on us.

283
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,227
Ah!

284
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,146
[Angela] Hi.

285
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,064
I'm Angela.

286
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,400
You gentlemen know what you want?

287
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,736
Everything, and l mean
everything on our shelves,

288
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,322
has been marked down
to rock-bottom prices...

289
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,699
You want me to give your program
free computers,

290
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,702
you understand l don't get them free
from the manufacturer.

291
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,038
The program isn't funded
to make purchases more than--

292
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,376
If these are people without money,
they're not likely to be my customers.

293
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,419
Look, you're a member of the community.

294
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,630
You do business here.
You hire local people.

295
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,466
[laughs] I wish I could hire local people.

296
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,968
I haven't had a night watchman
for two weeks.

297
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,679
You advertise for minimum wage,
you know who shows up?

298
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,431
Deviants show up.

299
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,934
Mentally disturbed people, blind people.

300
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,143
You need a security guard?

301
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,062
-You got someone?
-I might.

302
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,231
-This is a friend of yours?
-My wife's brother.

303
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,609
[laughs] Getting the old freeze-out, huh?

304
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,778
No tickee, no nookie.

305
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,030
Sure, tell him to come on over.

306
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,198
He's got a record.

307
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,076
-[video game weapons firing]
-This one's the ultimate, man.

308
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,412
This one makes Nintendo look pathetic.

309
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,664
I've never played Nintendo.

310
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,167
Where you been raised, boy?

311
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,669
You got a TV, don't you?

312
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,587
We got a TV.

313
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,548
And a VCR, right?

314
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,007
No.

315
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,846
Well, shit, man,
don't be inviting me over to your house,

316
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,141
watching some old
Mister Rogers network dog dookie.

317
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:38,645
Something else you need?
Stereo, VCR, CD player? A dehumidifier?

318
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,856
Thank you, no.
About Franklin, you don't have to...

319
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,025
Hey, look, he paid his debt, right?

320
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,778
Look, you're my representative
on the council.

321
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,407
Someday l got a matter
that needs representing, quid pro quo.

322
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,533
Am l right?

323
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,702
Bullshit. You haven't got a thing.

324
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,704
We've got the dumpster contract thing.

325
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,039
We've got the kickbacks
on the elderly lunch program.

326
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,959
We've got eight major no-show jobholders

327
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,128
donating a full quarter
of their generous salaries

328
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,504
to your political action fund.

329
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,090
-He's just blowing smoke, mayor.
-This just fell into our laps.

330
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,634
I hate to think what
a serious investigation would turn up.

331
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,095
Your guys want to bust my balls?
Hi, Phil, how you doing?

332
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,388
Not at all, Mr. Mayor.

333
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,973
The district attorney is well aware

334
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,392
that in municipal government
there are many gray areas.

335
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,188
Mrs. Spivak, say hello
to your mother for me.

336
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,064
-God bless you.
-God bless you.

337
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,150
What does he want?

338
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,862
The apartment buildings
we discussed before, on L Street.

339
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,489
He's your brother, Pauly. What's up?

340
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,617
He's putting the usual pressure on,
but won't go along with the other thing.

-[Zimmer] Gentlemen.

343
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,084
This is a conversation
I should not be hearing.

344
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,838
All you need to understand is that
the success of the development package

345
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,759
that's been proposed by certain
very good friends of the district attorney

346
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,303
has become essential
to your political future.

347
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,307
We're down to the wire on this, fellas.
We need results.

348
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,644
I'll leave the details
in your capable hands.

349
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,688
-[Bill] Larry.
-[Zimmer] Hey, Bill.

350
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,524
Is this a social visit
or are we under arrest?

351
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,441
[both laugh]

352
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,360
I hear your man's making a run
for the Senate.

353
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,111
Only a rumor, Bill. Only a rumor.

354

-If you need any help...
-[Zimmer] I'll keep that in mind.

355
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,991
I pay you 45 grand a year,
you can't deliver your own brother?

356
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:15,909
I talked to him.

357
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,202
-Lean on him, Pauly.
-With what?

358
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,621
Joey's hooked up with Kerrigan.
He's got his own thing going.

359
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,249
Gus, what'd they do?
Close down the dog track?

360
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,585
No, they made a mistake on my check.
They left off the overtime.

361
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,089
If you don't put in time, Gus,
how can you put in overtime?

362
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,466
I'd like to condemn your fucking house.

363
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,926
Have a good one, pal.

364
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,678
No, man, it's more than a guitar.

365
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,390
It's a pre-CBS Strat with a Kahler whammy,
single stack coil,

Eighteen. He dropped out this year.

my brother was when he died.

Hey, uh, did he tell you
about the demo we're doing?

393

Yeah, right. On whose nickel?

Well, that was something
we wanted to talk to you about, Nicky.

Carl is bigtime now, Nick.
The guy is connected.

398
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,517
took down half the waterfront,
but no one got a scratch?

399
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,520
That was Carl.
He's not just a loan shark anymore.

676
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,936
[band continues playing "I Want It Back"]

677
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,946
I like you.

678
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,656
What?

679
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,702
I don't really know you,
but I'm positive that l like you.

680
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,123
-Oh.
-I recognize you.

681
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,209
-You were a senior when l was in ninth.
-[song ends]

682
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,585
-You remember?
-[crowd applauding]

683
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,629
-[Bobby] Thank you very much.
-Yeah.

684
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,633
You had a brother who played basketball.
Right? He was ahead of me.

685
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,218
-[Bobby] Thanks for coming]
-Yeah.

686
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,928
-Tony.
-Tony Rinaldi.

687
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,596
He was a major heartthrob.

688
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,183
Yeah, he went over there, and...

689
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,476
Yeah.

690
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,186
Yeah, that was, um...

691
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:43,938
That was sad.

692
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,566
You went out with that, uh-- That creep.

693
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,485
That whosits, Michael Rizzo, right?

694
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,695
We got married.

695
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,240
Oh.

696
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:55,741
Really?

697
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,120
I walked right into that, huh?

698
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,583
Was he a creep in high school already?
I don't remember.

699
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:05,918
You're not with him anymore?

700
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,378
Free woman.

701
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,839
Well, listen, I'm Nick, and l like you.

702
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,927
But l gotta go. l gotta drive my friends
to pick up some equipment.

703
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,137
I'm like their designated driver,
you know what l mean?

704
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,890
But I'd like to see you again.

705
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,559
You didn't see me this time.

706
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:22,476
Huh?

707
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,104
It's nice to meet you.

708
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,022
I like you.

709
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,566
You said that. You don't know me.

710
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,986
Yeah, l do. You're something great.

711
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,950
I'm glad you think so.

712
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,578
[Bobby] Yo, Nicky, game time.

713
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,084
I will see you again. Believe this.

714
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,010
Hm.

715
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,762
Who's that?

716
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,765
Some drunk.

717
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,684
Cute drunk.

718
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,562
Very cute drunk.

719
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:10,024
White faggot-ass motherfuckers.

720
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,611
If they don't got a gun,
I'd fuck them up good.

721
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:14,653
Fuckers.

722
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,825
[Tito] We didn't do shit, man,
and they treat us like that.

723
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,994
Cracker-ass bastards.

724
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,287
Bastards.

725
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,875
We gonna do the time,
we might as well do the crime.

726
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,169
Dickless cocksuckers.

727
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,338
Yeah, we fuck them up good.

728
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,717
Look at this faggot-ass motherfucker.

729
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,850
-Hey.
-[Tito] Fuck, man, what you...?

730
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,185
Where you running, white boy?

731
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,645
Cut that out. Help.

732
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,772
Hey, hey. [grunting and gasping]

733
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,775
Shut the fuck up, faggot.

734
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,151
Cut-- [yells] Hey.

735
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,152
Cut it out.

736
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:57,738
Help.

737
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,657
[Tito] Grab him, Desmond.

738
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:01,992
[Les] Help, help.

739
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,328
-[Tito] Come back here, faggot.
-[Les] Help!

740
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,130
[grunts]

741
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,098
[tires screech]

742
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,353
[Paddy] Jesus, what happened to you?

743
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,565
All the other problems
we're hearing about tonight,

744
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,402
the unemployment,
the drugs, the street crimes,

745
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:40,864
those will always be the highest
where the people have the least education.

746
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,908
So you can pay now, or you can pay later.

747
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,453
If you had a brain tumor, you wouldn't
shop around for the cheapest surgeon,

748
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,746
you'd look for the best.

749
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:52,126
And that's what we're voting on tonight,
the best for our children.

750
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,881
Or do we sell out their futures
for a few tax dollars?

751
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,721
Thank you.

752
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,559
I think we're ready
for the vote now, folks.

753
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,690
All in favor of the motion
to implement Bond Issue C

754
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,485
as a method of raising additional revenues
for the city schools,

755
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,154
raise your hands.

756
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,531
All opposed?

757
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,452
The motion fails, seven votes to two.

758
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,954
[attendees applauding]

759
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:37,004
Quit kidding yourself, tough guy.
You're going one place. Get in here.

760
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,218
I mean, we can't go out on the street
and sell them ourselves.

761
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,970
Straight ahead up here.

762
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,723
Carl is giving us
45-percent wholesale value.

763
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:51,018
-The guy is slime.
-Yeah, but you owe him money, right?

764
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,604
So split this score,
and he'll be off your back.

765
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,482
Pull up to the loading dock.

766
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,325
We'll go around.
The key only works in the front.

767
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,660
You got a key?

768
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,871
I told you, it's simple. Like jerking off.

769
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,456
-What's jerking off?
-Come on, Moe.

770
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,791
Nyah! Nyah!

771
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,419
Oh, Christ.

772
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,724
You dead, sucker.

773
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,155
[lock clicks]

774
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,324
[Zip] "We'll beat the best price in town,

775
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,451
or else you get the shit for free.

776
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,161
Mad Anthony is the lowest."

777
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,873
We want the Mitsubishi, JVC, Panasonic,
top-dollar stuff only.

778
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,083
And nothing bulky.

779
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,501
-[Franklin] Freeze!
-Oh, shit.

780
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,127
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

781
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,881
-What are you doing here?
-What the fuck you mean?

782
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,466
Hold it, fucker. What you trying?

783
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,051
I'm getting down on the floor.

784
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,427
I told you to freeze.

785
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,680
-Is this Simon Says?
-Shut up. Get on the ground.

786
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,515
-That's what I was doing.
-You too.

787
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,725
Just relax. Don't shoot that thing, huh?

788
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,018
We haven't stolen nothing.

789
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,896
Maybe we could work a deal, huh?
How about 1 00 bucks?

790
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,774
-You ain't got 1 00 bucks.
-Shut up. We'll give you whatever we got.

791
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,110
If you don't shut up,
I'm gonna shoot your dick off.

792
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,237
I don't think this deal thing
is gonna work, Bob.

793
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,030
Zip, you stupid sack of shit.

794
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,324
You told me nobody was gonna be here.

795
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,286
Goddamn, you're the worst thieves
I ever seen.

796
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,037
I got to go call the cops now, all right?

797
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,457
Should we have our hands on the back
of our necks or something?

798
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,834
Do me a favor, will you?

799
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,461
Shoot his dick off.
I'll vouch for you in court.

800
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,104
[engine revving]

801
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,898
[tires screech]

802
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,319
[engine rumbling]

803
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,535
-[man 1] Fuck you, motherfuckers!
-[man 2] All right, fuck you!

804
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,620
[man 1] Stupid.

805
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,497
-[tires screeching]
-[men whooping]

806
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:33,013
The light's better, you've calmed down.
We need to be positive.

807
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,015
I was in the car when they caught them.

808
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,309
One more time now.

809
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,227
These the boys?

810
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,147
Yes, that's them. I'm positive.

811
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,902
Okay, I'll take you to Detective Riley.
He'll record your statement.

812
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,864
-Faggot.
-Man, what'd you have to hit him for?

813
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,116
Because he's a white motherfucking faggot.

814
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,409
How'd you know that?

815
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,664
Look, if they ask us,
we say he wanted to suck our dicks,

816
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,248
and we tried to get away.

817
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,501
What's that gonna do?

818
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,127
They drop the case.

819
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,339
Being a faggot's against the law,
so we walk.

820
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,592
-Say he put his hands on you.
-No, man.

821
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,427
Fuck, say he put them on you.

822
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,262
Didn't nobody touch me.

823
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,181
Whoa, no skin off my butt.

824
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,142
[Bobby] This is a gross
misfeasance of justice here.

825
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,061
When we walked by, the door was wide open.

826
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,272
What would you have done? We assumed
there was a 24-hour sale going on.

827
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,441
We stick our nose
in the door 2 fucking centimeters,

828
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,403
and fucking Rambo over here
comes down on us,

829
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,989
yelling out racial epitaphs,
waving his piece around.

830
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,032
This man is dangerous, officers.

831
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,076
He almost blew
my friend's private organs off.

832
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,120
The gun's got no bullets in it, sucker.

833
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,373
-No bullets?
-It's plastic.

834
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,418
-Know how embarrassing this is?
-Oh, shit.

835
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,004
-[Zip] You hear what he's saying, Bob?
-[Malik] Brother Franklin.

836
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,422
[Franklin] Hey, Tyrone.

837
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,339
Malik.

838
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,882
Nah, nah, Tyrone.

839
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,051
-Malik.
-Yeah, look at you.

840
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,511
Yeah, look at you, brother.

841
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,681
Oh, yeah, I was recently incarcerated.

842
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,890
Pretty sorry, huh?

843
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,267
So, what happened to you?

844
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,394
I've surrendered myself
to the will of Allah.

845
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,896
-[Levonne] I knew you'd pull this shit.
-Knowledge is power.

846
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,733
-Got a plate glass window, no witnesses...
-I spread it. What about you?

847
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,610
Well, I surrendered myself
to the will of Mad Anthony.

848
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,406
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita!
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita!

849
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,826
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita!
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita!

850
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,578
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita...

851
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,248
Yo, the dude was a faggot.
He got what he deserved.

852
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,500
Even if that was the case,
which I doubt,

853
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,586
it's not against the law
to be a homosexual.

854
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,503
Yes, it is.

855
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,173
You approach this guy...

856
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,924
The fucker approached us.

857
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,135
Hey, what's the story here?

858
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,221
They saying assault.
This faggot come up to us in the park.

859
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,182
This isn't any of your business, Levonne.

860
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,808
I'm making it my business.

861
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,227
He put his hands on Desmond.

862
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,731
-That true?
-[detective] Levonne.

863
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,940
Is that true?

864
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,152
He tried to... You know.

865
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,072
Yeah, but l popped him one.

866
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,949
So he'd run on away from us. Self-defense.

867
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:01,578
You boys don't say anything until
I get you some legal aid down here.

868
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,080
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

869
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,374
Levonne, this isn't a murder case.

870
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,963
Hey, Jeanette, you okay?

871
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,423
They got my boy here.

872
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,633
Is he one of those?

873
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,052
Oh, Lord.

874
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,847
-Did he do bad?
-[scoffs]

875
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,975
Just keep them quiet
till l can get them a lawyer, okay?

876
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,435
Go on, keep them quiet.

877
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,315
Uh... Hey, brother.

878
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,734
[laughs] Don't forget your weapon.

879
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,194
[officers laughing]

880
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,946
It's a jungle out there.

881
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,212
[Nick] Hi.

882
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,131
Hi.

883
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,259
Your friends in the band
never came back, huh?

884
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,927
Yeah, they got tied up.

885
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,804
Motor problems?

886
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,848
-It's like totally dead.
-Hm.

887
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,432
You know much about cars?

888
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,184
Not a thing. Do you?

889
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,102
No.

890
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,563
Then what are you doing
looking under the hood?

891
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,692
That's what people do, right?

892
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:19,030
You shouldn't be walking around here
alone at night.

893
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,115
I'll walk you home.

894
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,700
It's all right, I can manage.

895
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,077
I'm serious, it's dangerous around here.

896
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,912
Wait, look.

897
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,624
I'll walk on the other side of the street,
all right?

898
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,793
Don't be dramatic.

899
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,505
I'm on Lincoln, just between J and K.

900
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,090
Okay.

901
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,595
So are you happy?

902
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,348
What? What kind of question is that?

903
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,058
It's an important question.

904
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,021
You mean, am l happy right now?

905
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,523
With your life.
Are you happy with your life?

906
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,942
I'm not gonna tell you that.

907
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,778
What about you?

908
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,615
Me? No, I'm not happy.

909
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,619
Maybe if l had someone like you
to be with, l could be.

910
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,954
Are you always like this?

911
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,458
No, I'm usually, you know,
asking the regular bullshit.

912
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,544
Like, "What do you do?
What does your apartment rent for?"

913
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,463
I don't have time for that shit right now.

914
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,341
-You're on a deadline or something, huh?
-[exhales]

915
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,928
-You ever been in a car accident?
-Yeah.

916
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:26,181
Things, like, slow down,
they become real clear?

917
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:29,893
Important shit is going down in my life
right now all at once.

918
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,645
Like l saw you tonight.

919
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,898
Hey-- [chuckles] --I'm not that great.

920
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,524
Yeah, you are.

921
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,277
Well, tell me
the worst thing about yourself.

922
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,195
The worst.

923
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,366
I've put up with jerks in my life
for too long.

924
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,953
What, is that me? I'm a jerk?

925
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,663
I didn't say that.

926
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,622
Oh, thank you.

927
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,415
The jury's still out.

928
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,960
Do l turn your stomach
to look at or something?

929
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,628
No.

930
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,963
Well, am I neutral? Attractive?

931
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:01,925
You're a good-looking guy,
and you know it too. Big deal.

932
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,844
Well, I think you look fantastic.

933
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,596
Hm.

934
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,683
And if you're not married
or involved with anybody right now,

935
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,394
it's because nobody's figured out
what you're worth.

936
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:16,648
Hey.

937
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,233
Hey, what's the matter?

938
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,527
You can't say things like that.

939
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,070
Why not?

940
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,656
Because you don't know me. That's why not.

941
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,495
It's funny, I was married
for eight fucking years,

942
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,581
and my husband never said
one thing that nice to me.

943
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:38,795
Anyway, I don't know you,
so it's just words.

944
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:40,547
I'm sorry.

945
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,719
You were married eight years
to Michael Rizzo?

946
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,722
Who the fuck did you go out with
in high school?

947
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,265
Mary Ellen Battaglia.

948
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,559
-Mary Ellen Battaglia?
-Yeah.

949
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:56,730
Mary Ellen Battaglia
needed an instruction manual to chew gum.

950
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,023
She had other things, you know.

951
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,692
Yeah, she had tits in the third grade.

952
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,403
Her major fucking accomplishment in life.

953
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,489
Yeah, well, l didn't live with her
for eight years, you know?

954
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,910
Well, it was like l was with the Moonies
or something, you know?

955
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,165
It was my life.
Couldn't imagine anything else.

956
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,503
Did you have any kids?

957
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:22,630
I have a son.

958
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:23,548
Yeah?

959
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,425
That's cool.

960
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,634
Little guy, huh?

961
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,928
My mother takes him part of the time.

962
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,765
I'm going back to school
and I got a job at a restaurant.

963
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:32,682
DeLillo's.

964
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:34,809
Have you been following me?

965
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,561
No, I saw you in there once.

966
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,438
It's a public place, you know.

967
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,194
Jesse, uh-- That's my little boy.
--he, uh...

968
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,571
He has this disease.

969
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:50,325
Congenital. It makes him, like, spastic.

970
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,078
They call it "severely involved" now.

971
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,625
What do you do to have fun?

972
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,001
Fun?

973
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,839
I tell you, Nick,
it's like you asked me am I happy.

974
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:08,635
It's not something
I can think a whole lot about right now.

975
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,719
You said my name.

976
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,430
-What?
-Nick. You said, Nick.

977
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,432
I love that, you saying my name.

978
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,894
You are a strange fucker.

979
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,522
I think maybe you should
walk on the other side of the street,

980
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,439
like you said.

981
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,401
Listen, l could get my sister to babysit.
She owes me.

982
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,736
She's always borrowing money from me.
Then we could go out.

983
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:27,987
Hey, hey.

984
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:30,240
Slow down. Cool your jets.

985
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,076
I want you to take me seriously.

986
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,954
I don't think
you take yourself seriously, Nick.

987
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,498
I mean, those friends of yours, come on.

988
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,250
Yeah, l know, I know, but...

989
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:44,087
They're really not bad guys.
I mean, they're loyal.

990
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,297
Dogs are loyal.

991
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,813
Well, uh, this is my place.

992
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:06,818
You know when you're a kid,
a teenager, right?

993
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:11,072
And it's Saturday night, and you go out,
and every place you walk into,

994
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,700
you think, you know, this is it, you know?

995
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,078
There's gonna be somebody terrific
in here, I'll meet her,

996
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,789
and my life's gonna be
completely different after tonight.

997
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:23,209
Today has been a wild day for me.

998
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,795
I mean, unbelievable shit has gone down.

999
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,965
But I've had that feeling right here.

1000
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:33,261
I haven't had it in such a long time,
because it never happens.

1001
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:37,182
You never meet that girl,
or she's not the right one.

1002
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,185
And then I see you.

1003
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,899
You're gonna make me cry again.

1004
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,861
Damn it, I'm just...

1005
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,696
I'm kind of tired.

1006
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,906
Angela Sabino.

1007
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:54,991
Angela.

1008
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,619
That's what it sounds like.

1009
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,041
So, uh-- So, what if l call you up?

1010
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,712
Worse things could happen.

1011
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,511
Good night, Angela.

1012
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,679
Good night, Nick.

1013
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:24,020
[blues music playing]

1014
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,155
[music fades]

1015
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,043
You did it, didn't you?

1016
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:48,878
[Nick] What?

1017
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,881
Don't bullshit me, Rinaldi. You did it.

1018
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:52,799
I did what?

1019
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:54,634
Don't hand me that.

1020
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,097
What if I did?

1021
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,766
You're fucking with me now.

1022
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,059
Don't fuck with me.

1023
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,937
You did it, didn't you, you fuck?

1024
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,605
I saw you with her.

1025
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,235
You don't own her, Rizzo.

1026
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,862
And if you ever did,
then you don't anymore.

1027
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,156
You stay away from her.

1028
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,826
No, you stay away from me.

1029
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,704
You got your uniform,
your fucking badge, you're a big man, huh?

1030
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,124
This uniform is the only thing
that stands between you

1031
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,127
and a fucking trip
to the hospital right now, pal.

1032
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,963
If I was off-duty, I'd bury you.

1033
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,590
Yeah? What time you get off?

1034
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,509
You're history, Rinaldi.

1035
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:38,928
You're dead.

1036
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,394
You're out of line, Mike.

1037
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,895
It's none of your business.

1038
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,814
You ride with me,
that makes it my business.

1039
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,358
You settle your personal shit
on your own time.

1040
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,027
Fine. Just butt out, okay?

1041
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,069
No problem.

1042
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,868
You're gonna get yourself in trouble.

1043
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,287
Just shut the fuck up about it, huh?

1044
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,588
They popped the window
out of here last night.

1045
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,424
Gonna be all over us in the papers.

1046
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,596
This is all a part
of a systematic campaign

1047
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,306
to undermine Black manhood
in this country.

1048
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,892
You stand up for yourself,
the white boy cuts you down.

1049
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,354
These young brothers are being sacrificed
into the jaws of the racist conspiracy.

1050
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,481
That's three pages.
I'll have to do some editing.

1051
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,734
We had Dwight Rollins, unarmed,
shot to death by racist police this April.

1052
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,944
Hollis Washington beaten to death
while in custody.

1053
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,698
Why don't you ask the Great White Hope
what he thinks about it?

1054
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,200
Somebody busted your window?

1055
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,952
Morning, Wynn. What do you plan
to do about this park thing?

1056
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,621
-Park thing?
-[Levonne] Yeah.

1057
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,376
Two young Black men approached in a park
by a white homosexual.

1058
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,877
They give him what for,

1059
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,880
next thing you know,
they're run in by the cops for assault.

1060
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:56,798
Last night?

1061
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,091
What are you gonna do about it?

1062
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,178
-Call the police...
-Go straight to the enemy.

1063
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,972
Man got nothing to say
for the African-American community.

1064
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,599
Man just a stooge in the system.

1065
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,561
Half of everything you say is true, Malik.
The other half is pure shit.

1066
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,940
-That's off the record, Kyle.
-Fucking politicians.

1067
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,900
Off the fucking record, Wynn.

1068
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,236
What do you plan to do
for the young brothers?

1069
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,779
First I'll investigate the charges.

1070
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,864
You saying the brothers are lying?
Is that what?

1071
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:26,285
Councilman Himes promised a thorough
investigation of the incident. Period.

1072
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,621
Excuse me.

1073
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,500
Fucking politicians.

1074
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,836
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do about this, Les.

1075
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,757
I just want you to understand
the kind of pressure we are under here.

1076
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,678
First thing this morning, l get a call
from the P Street Community Center.

1077
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,097
I'm not backing down.
Those kids are dangerous.

1078
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:50,226
I understand that,
but the homosexual thing complicates it.

1079
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,020
We have a very tenuous relationship
with the people in this city.

1080
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,439
What homosexual thing?

1081
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,108
They didn't tell you?

1082
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,487
The boys said you made advances to them.

1083
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,530
Goddamn it.

1084
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,533
There was a follow-up call
from the police department.

1085
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,119
-Hi, Les.
-In light of the circumstances...

1086
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,164
-That's a lie.
-Oh, God, what happened to him?

1087
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,416
I saw an article
in the paper this morning.

1088
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,585
He was mugged in the park
by some kids last night.

1089
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,920
Oh, God. Did they say what race?

1090
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:21,257
-What?
-The race of the kids, Black or white?

1091
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,509
-Black.
-Oh, great.

1092
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,928
That doesn't have anything to do with you.

1093
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:29,390
-Suzanne, you know better than that.
-[Angela] He's younger, but not that much.

1094
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:34,020
I was a senior when he was in ninth grade.
By now that's not such a big deal, right?

1095
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:37,356
And he's good-looking and everything,
so I don't think much about it.

1096
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:41,235
I get out to my car, it's dead.
Turn the key, not a sound.

1097
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,323
That piece of shit that Michael left me,
I hate to even look at the thing.

1098
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:49,952
And then he shows up, this guy, Nick,
and he's, like, lost or something.

1099
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,413
[laughs]
Listen to me talk about this stuff.

1100
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,123
-Am l stupid or what?
-They beat me up.

1101
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,168
They say l came on to them?
I'm sorry, but to me that's a big deal.

1102
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,836
-It is.
-There's a principle involved.

1103
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,546
A very important principle.

1104
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,591
Of course there is, Les, if you say so.

1105
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,759
I'm not a homosexual.

1106
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,637
I understand that,
but we have a public profile.

1107
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,057
And if l was, so what?
What does this school stand for?

1108
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,142
Let's do this inside, okay?

1109
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,478
We have your prints all over the van.

1110
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,479
Outstanding.

1111
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,106
An ever-tightening net
of circumstantial evidence.

1112
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:20,525
Who was the third guy?

1113
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,068
You got the prints. You tell us.

1114
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,279
You give me a name,
I'll put a word in with the court.

1115
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,574
You guys hang around
with Nick Rinaldi, don't you?

1116
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,492
Nick who?

1117
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,245
Forget it, Bob.
He's too fucking smart for us.

1118
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:33,955
Look, we give up.

1119
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:35,915
It was him.

1120
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,333
[Bobby] Yo, Asteroid.

1121
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,794
-Say, "I did it."
-[Asteroid] l did it.

1122
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,798
-[Bobby] No, l did it. No, I did it.
-[Asteroid] No, l did it. No, I did it.

1123
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,634
-[Zip laughing]
-I did it. No, l did it. l did it.

1124
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,386
No, I did it.

1125
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,681
-No, I did it. l did it. l did it.
-[Zip and Bobby laughing]

1126
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,141
I did it. l did it. No, no, I...

1127
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,142
No, I did it.

1128
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,447
[car engine revving]

1129
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,200
[tires screech]

1130
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:14,120
-Hey, O'B.
-[engine stops]

1131
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,830
Long time no see.

1132
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,165
Engine problems?

1133
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,793
You're the one with the problem, Carl.
Get in.

1134
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,879
[pneumatic wrench whirring]

1135
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,722
Nice rig you got here, O'Brien.

1136
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,932
You're doing all right for yourself.

1137
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,268
-I can always be doing better.
-Aw.

1138
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:41,355
I hate to see a man unsatisfied
with his station in life.

1139
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,523
What's the beef?

1140
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,817
Mad Anthony's? Last night?

1141
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,403
Can't help you. How much did they clear?

1142
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,114
Nada, your little friends Bobby and Zip
tripped over their dicks.

1143
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,490
You should know better.

1144
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,826
-Got nothing to do with me.
-They talked.

1145
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:57,580
I don't fall for that shit, O'Brien.
You should know better.

1146
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,291
I got Leo Snider at Rahway
coming up for review.

1147
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,711
He says if l help him,
he'll put your ass away for me.

1148
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,421
The vending machine hijack?

1149
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,506
Lehman's furs?

1150
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,926
The fire on the waterfront.

1151
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,678
Why not throw
in the Kennedy assassination?

1152
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:17,016
I hate to be the one to break this to you,
but a lot of people don't like you, Carl.

1153
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,184
What do you want?

1154
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,269
Suspect number three.

1155
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:24,899
Somebody left a hot van
outside of Anthony's.

1156
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,276
The security guy says
he saw the third outside,

1157
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,444
but he couldn't make him.

1158
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,907
I figure that somebody
on the inside gave you the key.

1159
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:33,908
That's all?

1160
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,285
And a player to be named at a future date.

1161
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:42,875
Nick Rinaldi.

1162
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,419
Oh, that's very good news.

1163
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:48,297
You know, we should have a talk
like this more often.

1164
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,758
You tell Snider to eat shit and die.

1165
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,218
You sound bitter, Carl.

1166
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:56,180
I hate to see a man unhappy
with his station in life.

1167
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,391
[engine starts]

1168
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:01,811
Hey, Carl.

1169
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,149
Somebody pulled the distributor head
off this thing.

1170
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,359
There's nothing to it.

1171
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,361
Whose car is it?

1172
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,446
I don't know. Some girl.

1173
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,531
Hook brung it in.

1174
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,574
Uh...

1175
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:18,369
Tell her we're gonna replace
the ignition system.

1176
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,540
Hey, Carl.

1177
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,293
When are you gonna give me something?

1178
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,254
You tell your boyfriend Ramirez

1179
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,965
he can come in by himself
or we can bring him in.

1180
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,384
The second way is not gonna be any fun.

1181
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,553
This is a condemned building, miss.

1182
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,847
I give you two days.

1183
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,308
Two days, l come back here,
you better be gone, comprende?

1184
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,476
[Tommy] Let's go, Mike.

1185
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,277
Jesus, what a pit.

That baby is gonna get sick.

1187
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,284
I used to come in here
and shoot pigeons up on the 4th floor.

1188
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,412
Hundreds of them.
They come in through the broken windows.

1189
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,581
It's good for the reflexes.

1190
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,876
Yeah, you should slow
those reflexes down a little bit.

1191
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,962
Can you imagine living
in a place like this?

1192
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,131
My father lived here when he was a kid.

1193
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:16,010
A different building on the same spot.
Probably the same kind of dump.

1194
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,887
But he got himself out, right?

1195
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,765
He ran numbers
till his cousin got him on a job.

1196
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,476
Then you guineas moved in,
the place went to hell.

You got a septic clearance
that isn't up to spec.

1296
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,799
I got a green light on that months ago.

1297
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,343
Yeah, but not on paper.

1298
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,470
You know where it came from.

1299
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:13,640
I know. Then I suggest you go back
to where it came from, and talk to them.

1300
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,642
What the fuck you think I'm out here for?

1301
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,146
Septic clearance, my ass.

1302
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:22,566
Still on the clock, Joe.

1303
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:26,236
You call Belcher and get off the clock.
This could take a week.

1304
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:28,822
Belcher says no breaks from the Local.

1305
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,115

on the way downtown.

It's this fucking L Street deal.

1323

We got worse problems than that, Joe.
Nicky's in trouble.

1324
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,413
What trouble?

1325
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,498
He and Bobby Krausse and that kid Zip,

1326
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,959
they tried to do
Anthony's warehouse last night.

1327
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,585
What, is he in jail?

1328
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,963
No, he got away,
but they know he was in on it.

1329
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,382
It doesn't make sense.

1330
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,676
Why would Nicky need to do a robbery?

1332
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,929
-Was anybody hurt?
-No, no guns.

1333
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,722
But the thing about it is,

1334
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,016
the DA's office is butting into it.

1335
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,018
The guy's bucking for Senate, right.

1336
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,396
They figure they go after Nicky,
respectable family,

1337
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,983
juice with the people downtown,
shows he's impartial, right?

1338
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,943
Incorruptible, all that shit.

1339
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,695
They're trying to bury him, Joe.

1340
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,614
They got a stolen van,
Anthony's place, no mercy.

1341
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,994
I asked the mayor as a personal favor
to hold them off.

1342
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,162
He's made an effort.

1343
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:01,206
But l gotta tell you,
I don't think his heart is in it.

1344
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:04,960
And what would it take
to put his heart back into it?

1345
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,796
What we talked about
with L Street. Tonight.

1346
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,510
This is my kid.

1347
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,388
You're using my kid against me like this?

1348
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,306
Your nephew?

1349
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,642
It's grand larceny, Joe.
And Nicky put us here, not me.

1350
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,566
Look at this place, Joe. It's a dump.

1351
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,194
It wouldn't be
if your outfit didn't have my hands tied.

1352
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,696
It's coming down anyway, sooner or later.

1353
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,244
They're not asking you
to do the thing itself.

1354
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:44,541
They just need to be sure once it's done,
you don't go fixing the place back up.

1355
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,753
Where's Nicky?

1356
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,132
He's okay. They haven't found him yet.
I put the word out, kid gloves.

1357
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:56,011
I'm gonna have to go to Kerrigan on this.

1358
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,599
What the fuck?

1359
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:03,435
Yo.

1360
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,063
Gus.

1361
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,524
Hello, Joe, what do you know?

1362
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,525
What's this?

1363
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:12,736
You got six or seven violations here.
I haven't even been to the basement yet.

1364
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,654
Oh, you.

1365
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,739
You're gonna pay some fines, Joe.

1366
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,115
Oh, you fuck.

1367
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:21,245
And just yesterday it was all up to code.

1368
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,289
Things fall apart quick, don't they?

1369
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:31,088
[diners chattering]

1370
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,133
-Hi.
-Hi.

1371
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:36,301
I'm Nick. I was...

1372
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,054
Yeah, I'll go get her. She's in the annex.

1373
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:39,972
Thanks.

1374
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,184
Yo, Nicky, you a busboy here or what?

1375
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:46,603
-[Nick] What are you guys doing out?
-City shut us down.

1376
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:47,604
[Nick] What for?

1377
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,565
What do you care? You quit.

1378
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,108
Nicky, come over here.

1379
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,401
I wanna talk to you.

1380
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:05,706
Nicky, the cops come by
just after your old man left the site.

1381
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,874
-You in trouble?
-[sighs]

1382
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,042
I might be.

1383
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:13,005
-You need a few bills to see you through?
-No, no, no.

1384
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,465
They had a real hard-on for you, Nicky.

1385
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:18,218
If I were you, I wouldn't go back
to your place for a while.

1386
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,345
Take it light, huh?

1387
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,514
Thanks.

1388
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:23,724
[Wynn] All l see right now

1389
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:27,019
is that you and your people are
selling off my district, piece by piece.

1390
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,729
What brings revenue to the city,

1391
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,315
what brings life to the city,
is good for everybody.

1392
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,442
Right, the trickle-down theory.

1393
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,819
But things only seem
to trickle down so far.

1394
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,488
Can't expect the developer to build
if he can't make a profit.

1395
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:40,949
You don't expect people
to watch their neighborhood be plowed

1396
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,117
without lifting a finger.

1397
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,702
The development creates jobs.

1398
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,954
With jobs, people can afford higher rents.

1399
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,582
And those jobs are gonna go
to the people on L Street?

1400
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,875
Tell me another one.

1401
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,002
[laughs]

1402
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,838
I was hoping that
we could cut some kind of a deal here.

1403
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,340
You mean a personal deal?

1404
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:59,301
I hear that you got your brother-in-law
on Mad Anthony's payroll.

1405
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,385
What does that mean?

1406
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,304
I understand what it's like.

1407
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,431
New guy on the council.

1408
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,183
The last man at the banquet.

1409
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,185
People expect you to deliver.

1410
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,063
Okay, I got housing inspectors,

1411
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,898
I got teacher's aides.

1412
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,275
You keep pushing Galaxy Towers
the way it's set up now,

1413
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,944
we'll fight you
on blighting classification, on evictions,

1414
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:22,282
on construction and demolition,
every little step of the way.

1415
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,326
We'll make the L Street apartments
a symbol

1416
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,037
for everything
that's fucked up in this city.

1417
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:30,290
They can't be a symbol
if they aren't there.

1418
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,503
Sounds like they got you
by the short one, Joey.

1419
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:36,922
I was wondering, uh,

1420
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:40,217
since your people fronted me
the money on this thing...

1421
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:43,303
[laughs]
You want me to get Baci off your back?

1422
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:46,390
Well, he's hurting your investment.

1423
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,350
We invested in you, Joe.

1424
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:52,562
This creep,
he's using my family against me.

1425
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,149
You think he didn't check with us
before he made a move?

1426
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,445
And if l blow my bid
on the apartment building?

1427
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,780
If I can't make the payments?

1428
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,490
What would a regular bank do?

1429
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:08,161
You're not a regular bank.
I'm carrying your people on my payroll.

1430
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:12,499
Look, Joe.

1431
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,710
We appreciate that.

1432
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:16,294
We really do.

1433
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:21,049
You'd still get to put up buildings,
you just wouldn't be your own boss.

1434
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,969
Maybe you never were, really.

1435
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:29,015
I borrowed from you
to get something for myself.

1436
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,562
Without Baci, without my brother.

1437
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:38,233
That's not the way our society works, Joe.

1438
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:41,778
You got something good, first everybody
on top of you gets a taste,

1439
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,614
then you share what's left
with everybody below you.

1440
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:48,243
We're social animals,
human beings, not dogs.

1441
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,497
Come on, Joe. You'll do what you have to.

1442
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,668
And the people who know,
the people that count,

1443
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,754
they'll understand, Joe.

1444
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,047
They'll respect you for it.

1445
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:04,301
Thanks.

1446
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,234
Shit.

1447
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,152
[Roger] Les?

1448
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,863
Preparing a lecture?

1449
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,448
Right.

1450
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:33,955
Listen, we heard about you getting mugged.

1451
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,875
I was really sad to hear that.

1452
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,084
Thanks.

1453
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,295
And we heard the rest,

1454
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:43,173
the rumor, about the countercharges.

1455
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,219
I wanted to say that we're really glad
you're gonna fight this out.

1456
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:48,637
Who's "we"?

1457
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:53,225
"We" us.

1458
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:56,144
You know, those of us
who are gay on the faculty,

1459
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,021
our friends in the community.

1460
01:11:58,105 --> 01:11:59,856
How could everybody
have heard of it so soon?

1461
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:03,902
Anyhow, we... l think it's great
that you're taking a stand.

1462
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,654
Who says I'm taking a stand?

1463
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,155
I'm not gay, Roger.

1464
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,323
We know that.

1465
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,449
What if I stonewall,

1466
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:13,286
and the police and the press
and everybody believe the boys?

1467
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,163
What if it backfires? What...?

1468
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:19,125
What if it plays right into the hands
of the racists and the fag-bashers?

1469
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,043
Homophobics.

1470
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,586
Sorry. But what if that happens?

1471
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,256
If you just roll over for them,
they'll never change.

1472
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,178
Hi.

1473
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:31,638
Hi.

1474
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,558
Oh, um, l heard about Les.

1475
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:35,976
That's so awful.

1476
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:36,893
Yeah.

1477
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:42,399
Take care.

1478
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:43,733
Yeah, you too.

1479
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,072
[sighs]

1480
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:53,910
-Hi, baby.
-Hi.

1481
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:55,996
How'd it go today?

1482
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,540
Les Pullman was mugged last night.

1483
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:00,709
I know.

1484
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,211
It's gonna get worse too.

1485
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,671
How could it get worse?

1486
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:07,382
The two kids who beat him up
say he was coming on to them.

1487
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,050
Les isn't gay.

1488
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,427
How do we know that?

1489
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:11,803
Because he isn't.

1490
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,848
Levonne Willis is stirring the pot.

1491
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,142
Worked up a meeting tomorrow
at the community center.

1492
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,228
The whole point is
to nail me to the wall in public.

1493
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,981
Don't be paranoid.
Do you know who these boys are?

1494
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,816
I talked to one of them.

1495
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,277
Do you think he was telling the truth?

1496
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:30,405
Levonne will have me up in front
of every heavy hitter in the community.

1497
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,824
The Black press, everyone.
He'll ask that same question.

1498
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,743
How do you think I'd better answer?

1499
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,536
Do you think they were telling the truth?

1500
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,872
Politically speaking, it doesn't matter.

1501
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,334
It matters to me.

1502
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:48,173
[Angela]
You like that. You like that, don't you?

1503
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:52,302
Yes, you like that. You like that so much.

1504
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,388
I'm 1 0 years older than my brother was
when he was killed.

1505
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,682
Okay, let's go for a walk, okay?

1506
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,225
He was just a kid.

1507
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,977
My big famous brother.

1508
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,732
-I've been thinking...
-Good boy.

1509
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:09,027
What have l done with my life
in those last 1 0 years?

1510
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,656
I mean, what have l got
to show for all that time?

1511
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,617
What do you think you should've done?

1512
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:17,869
I don't know.

1513
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,163
Have a family?

1514
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:23,416
No, not a family.

1515
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,001
Do something heroic?

1516
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:28,505
Maybe. Not...
You know, not in the Army, though.

1517
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:31,091
-What is that? What is that?
-Nothing like that.

1518
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,175
Something big.

1519
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,719
I want to be my own boss.

1520
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,680
What, like your father?

1521
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:37,889
No.

1522
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,057
Not like him.

1523
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,184
Not anything like him.

1524
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:45,855
[melancholy, pensive music playing]

1525

[music fades]

1526
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:07,168
So it's you.

1527
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:08,712
Yeah.

1528
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:10,922
I guess l shouldn't be surprised.

1529
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,217
People do favors for me,
I do favors for them.

1530
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,970
You know how it works, Joe.

1531
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,388
Why does it have to be tonight?

1532
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:20,640
Look, the fire is very minor.

1533
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,810
We gut two or three floors
on the abandoned side,

1534
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,520
other side of the firewall.

1535
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:26,855
After I get my kid in there,

1536
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,608
make a few adjustments
to the sprinkler system, we get a flood.

1537
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:31,735
Water damage.

1538
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:35,030
Nobody gets hurt,
nobody moves back in either.

1539
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:36,531
I don't like it.

1540
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,742
You're not supposed to like it, Joe.

1541
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:42,912
You're supposed to bend over,
spread your cheeks, take it like a man.

1542
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,541
Not too fucking thrilled about it myself.

1543
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,627
Don't organize any block parties
down there tonight.

1544
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,760
It's life, Joe. What are you gonna do?

1545
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,975
[melancholy, pensive music resumes]

1546
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,688
You don't have to do this, you know.

1547
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,482
I'm not gonna let them run my life.

1548
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,275
If I back down now, they win.

1549
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,903
Who's keeping score?

1550
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,073
I'll see you in a bit.

1551
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,861
I have to be careful when he's got a cold.

1552
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,781
He's always had a hard time breathing.

1553
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:07,997
Hey, you shaved.

1554
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,833
Yeah, there was a razor in there.

1555
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:11,042
Ooh.

1556
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:12,794
I use that for my legs.

1557
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,047
You're lucky you got skin left.

1558
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,676
Yeah, well, l haven't been
to my place all day.

1559
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,469
You break up with your girlfriend?

1560
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:25,348
Oh, I haven't been with anybody
for a while now.

1561
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:26,724
Why not?

1562
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,685
Whenever l need somebody,

1563
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,230
it's like, zap,
all the women in the world disappear.

1564
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:36,234
I swear they smell me coming
from a block away and they hide somewhere.

1565
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,320
It's the same with guys
when they find out I got a kid.

1566
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:42,907
They figure all l got on my mind
is roping them into getting married.

1567
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,662
Well, what is it you got on your mind?

1568
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:51,124
Usually something about
how much sleep I can get,

1569
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,668
and still go to school, and go to work,

1570
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:55,879
and do Jesse's therapy every night.

1571
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,464
It's very romantic.

1572
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:03,428
I guess you can get used to anything.

1573
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,347
I don't wanna get used to it. It sucks.

1574
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,162
You, uh-- You can't be a creep, okay?

1575
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,874
I mean, you start any bullshit,
I just don't have the energy.

1576
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,334
I'll do my best.

1577
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:36,961
I'm kind of defensive, huh?

1578
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,548
You're like a surgeon general's warning
with legs.

1579
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,633
I'm sorry.

1580
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,801
I mean it though, huh?

1581
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,471
Don't worry about it.

1582
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:25,677
Do you have anything?

1583
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,595
Aren't you on anything?

1584
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,056
No, I have something.

1585
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,976
You got quite a supply there.

What is it?

1593
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,294
It's all right.

1594
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,382
You still up for this?

1595

01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,533
-Nick.
-Hey, what'd I tell you?

1699
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,702
Yo, back it up, let's go.

1700
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:50,830
Hey, Paddy.
Have we still got a want on that kid?

1701
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:52,665
It's that Ramirez.

1702
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:55,000
[firefighter speaking indistinctly]

1703
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:57,878
-After the funeral.
-[siren wailing]

1704
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,213
All right, come on...

1705
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:02,299
[blues music playing]

1706
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,726
Help, help.

1707
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,645
Help, we need help. Help.

1708
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,022
Any messages for me?

1709
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:21,360
We got bargains. We got deals.

1710
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,071
All your electronics needs.

1711
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:29,160
We got deals.
Under one roof. Under one roof.

1712
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,620
Help, help. We need help.

1713
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,789
Man, who the fuck are you?

1714
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:36,125
I am the lowest. Who the fuck are you?

1715
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:39,712
Look... Hey, Levonne.
Levonne, you working here?

1716
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,339
No, I just came by to check out the show.

1717
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:45,009
I ain't seen so much paper in all my life.

1718
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,094
All of them ask the same damn questions.

1719
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:50,222
You see, it helps them
to stall while they try to figure out...

1720
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:52,933
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

1721
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:55,478
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

1722
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:59,482
Money talks, nobody walks.
Money talks, nobody walks.

1723
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:01,233
Money talks, nobody walks...

1724
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,153
[speaking in Spanish]

1725
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:09,825
-[in English] Hi, Wynn.
-Uh...

1726
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,994
Hi. How many people was it?

1727
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:15,873
Uh, 1 3 families, a couple of singles.

1728
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,083
Only a few have family they can stay with.

1729
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:21,086
How long till they rehab the side
that didn't burn?

1730
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:22,880
Rinaldi says it's totaled.

1731
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,549
He's gonna knock it down
and sell the land.

1732
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,052
The development package.

1733
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:31,055
Not very subtle, are they?

1734
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,223
[speaks in Spanish]

1735
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,309
-[in English] I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

1736
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:37,686
Levonne.

1737
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,272
What's this, Wynn?

1738
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:41,440
Photo opportunity?

1739
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:43,484
And what would you be saying
if l didn't come?

1740
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:45,778
-Hi.
-Hi.

1741
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:46,987
Whose is this?

1742
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:48,906
-Mine. Hold her for a minute?
-Yeah?

1743
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,075
-Yeah. Felice had to work today.
-Hey, there.

1744
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,201
What's your name?

1745
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,453
[laughs] She looks just like you.

1746
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:55,621
Yeah, maybe.

1747
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:59,083
Can l talk to you?
I wish you'd reconsider this meeting.

1748
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,502
If you have to kiss the man's ass,
that's your problem.

1749
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:04,922
That's off the point. This here,
this is what's worth fighting for.

1750
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,550
-We have to choose where we make a stand.
-What "we"?

1751
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:09,301
Okay, it's your ass.

1752
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:21,856
They probably started it themselves.

1753
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:24,358
They had no power in there.

1754
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:28,404
They used candles and shit.
Probably knocked something over.

1755
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,030
Arson.

1756
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,115
Huh?

1757
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,742
Arson. It was a torch job. Professional.

1758
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:37,913
How do you know that?

1759
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:40,499
Because l lived here 40 years, that's how.

1760
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:43,752
Listen to me, I want you
to be calm about this, all right?

1761
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:46,213
The guy you went off on yesterday
made the charts.

1762
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:47,506
Nick Rinaldi?

1763
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:49,842
What'd he do?

1764
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,051
Robbery suspect.

1765
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:52,970
Suspect, right?

1766
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,723
No guns involved. No priors.

1767
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,434
No reason to believe
he's armed or dangerous.

1768
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,020
We see him, you stay in the car,
I make the collar, right?

1769
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:03,439
-Right?
-Right.

1770
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,941
Just let me at him in the fucking car.

1771
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:07,151
You're a mess, kid.

1772
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:10,446
Where you turning?

1773
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,866
The site up here. He was working that job.

1774
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:16,118
Ferraro checked it out yesterday. He quit.

1775
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,329
Fucking deadbeat.

1776
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:21,332
She takes up
with a fucking deadbeat thief.

1777
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,750
What's it to you anymore?

1778
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:25,085
Hey, Tom, it reflects on me, all right?

1779
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:27,671
She's my ex-wife, the mother of my child.

1780
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:28,756
Child?

1781
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:31,383
You never told me you had a kid.

1782
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:33,302
Boy or girl?

1783
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:34,970
Boy.

1784
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:36,388
How old?

1785
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:39,391
He's 2.

1786
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,353
Huh. Two-year-old son, huh?

1787
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,230
I never knew you had a kid.

1788
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:48,817
Well, I do.

1789
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:56,283
[man speaking indistinctly]

1790
01:30:57,744 --> 01:31:01,914
If you like that one, I'll be glad
to make the estimate for you.

1791
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:06,543
Hector.

1792
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:10,798
Whatever she wants,
you cut your price in half.

1793
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:12,758
I'll pay the difference.

1794
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:15,302
And don't let her know.

1795
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,017
-[man 1] Hey, Errol.
-[man 2] Hey, Errol.

1796
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,477
Morning, fellas.

1797
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:27,314
It was a lot more fun playing here
when they were afraid of me.

1798
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,733
-I took them to court.
-This was restricted?

1799
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:32,903
Yeah, no Blacks, no Jews,
no undesirable elements.

1800
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:36,740
I'd hang out at the 1 8th green
by the clubhouse, and just smile,

1801
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:39,660
and make the old bastards
1 2-putt the final hole.

1802
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,996
Took two years before anybody said hello.

1803
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,498
Must've been tough
to concentrate on your game.

1804
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,583
I never played better.

1805
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,800
So you've got yourself
a nice little mess, Wynn.

1806
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,844
Makes me glad I'm retired.

1807
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:58,637
You were operating on a bigger scale.

1808
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,055
Scale doesn't matter.

1809
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,099
You always try to gain some ground,

1810
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:05,227
no matter what the situation is,
and make some good come out of it.

1811
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:07,396
I don't see how this is good for anybody.

1812
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,148
You think those boys are lying, don't you?

1813
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:11,442
-Well...
-You wouldn't be here otherwise.

1814
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,403
I think it's too big
for them to go back on their story now.

1815
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,489
[laughs]

1816
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:21,577
I didn't use enough club.

1817
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:26,040
I hate it when I do that.
I nibble my way up to the green.

1818
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:27,332
It's a failure of nerve.

1819
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:29,293
Why l have to take a stance
on this at all...

1820
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,128
-You're not a policeman.
-Right.

1821
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,504
-Nor a judge.
-Right.

1822
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:33,422
Right.

1823
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,633
But the moment will come
when Levonne will put it to me

1824
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:39,887
in front of the whole community,
"Do you think our boys are lying?"

1825
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:41,930
Wedge?

1826
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:44,475
[sighs] What?

1827
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,352
Do you think l could use a wedge
from this far out?

1828
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,396
[sighs] l don't play.

1829
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:52,274
-Tennis? Racquetball?
-I don't play anything.

1830
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,569
You do have a problem.

1831
01:32:58,364 --> 01:32:59,198
You, um...

1832
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,910
You could say you believe them.

1833
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:06,455
If we're gonna take power,
we have to take responsibility too.

1834
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,291
You're absolutely right, professor.

1835
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,294
How are you, darling?

1836
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:14,922
It's good to see you up and around again.

1837
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,674
You got your color back. That's marvelous.

1838
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:20,719
Oh, you should've been there last night.
We had a big one.

1839
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,763
The equipment our boys have now.

1840
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,932
Not like in your day,
a bucket and a ladder.

1841
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:26,809
How's your fingers, huh? Make a fist.

1842
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:28,227
Beautiful, beautiful.

1843
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:31,897
Did you come for the lasagna, Joe,
or is this official business?

1844
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:33,774
Two people are dead because of you and me.

1845
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:36,985
They were trespassing. Those are the kind
of people accidents happen to.

1846
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:38,946
You suck.

1847
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,907
Joe, things change fast.

1848
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:44,910
People get hurt. I'm sorry about that.

1849
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:46,495
It was an accident.

1850
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:48,122
Now if everybody stands up

1851
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:51,041
like a good soldier,
we can stay on top of it.

1852
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:54,253
Joe, in the next couple of years,

1853
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:57,297
this town is gonna be one big yard sale.

1854
01:33:57,382 --> 01:34:00,634
And anyone with a half a brain
will make tracks,

1855
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:05,013
let the Blacks and the Spanish
duke it out over whatever's left.

1856
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,766
I want you off of my kid.

1857
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:11,186
I'll call Walsh.
We'll take his name out of the computer.

1858
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,396
It never happened.

1859
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,313
And the other two?

1860
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:17,526
Anthony is good people.
He'll drop the charges if l tell him to.

1861
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:19,570
Tell him to.

1862
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,613
[all] Surprise.

1863
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:27,411
Mrs. Donnelly, 90 years old.

1864
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:32,082
Joe, 90 years ago,
the Irish ran this town.

1865
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:34,751
There were horses shitting
on Jefferson Street.

1866
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:38,172
My grandfather got here off the boat.

1867
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:40,465
They gave him a scoop and a shovel.

1868
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:42,509
Now l run the place.

1869
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:44,761

-Let's try it one more time.
-[knocks on door]

1876
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:14,124
I'm gonna step out for a second.

1877
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:17,377
If I'm not back,
do The Star-Spangled Banner, okay??

1878
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:21,048
I wanna be able
to hear your voice, Warren.

1879
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,510
Where the hell have you been?

1880
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:28,096
I've been calling your apartment.
There were police.

1881
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:30,098
-They came here?
-Oh, yeah. Big show.

1882
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:32,142
Kids treated me like a TV star.

1883
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,518
I got some problems.

1884
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:36,188
Being late with the rent
is having some problems, Nick.

1885
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:39,524
Cops after you for robbery
is being seriously fucked up.

1886
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,026
-Listen.
-No, you listen.

1887
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:43,028
You know where Mom was this morning?

1888
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:44,988
In church, praying for you.

1889
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:48,408
You turn her into a religious fanatic,
Nicky, so help me...

1890
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:51,203
Laurie, l need you to do something for me.

1891
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:53,330
We had a deal.

1892
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:55,374
You remember?

1893
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:58,752
After Tony died?
You and me against the world.

1894
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:04,841
How come I'm always helping you out
and I never get anything back?

1895
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:07,135
I helped you with that marriage deal.

1896
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:08,845
You fucked up my engagement.

1897
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:09,763
He was an asshole.

1898
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,223
He was my asshole.

1899
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:13,100
Hey, listen, listen, listen.

1900
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,352
I'm gonna turn myself in, okay?

1901
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:18,146
I just need
to straighten some things out first.

1902
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:20,649
I think Dad might be in trouble.

1903
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:24,903
Yeah, one of his apartment buildings
burned down last night.

1904
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:27,155
People were killed.
Yeah, I'd say he's got trouble.

1905
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:30,450
I think it might be worse than that,
all right?

1906
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:32,286
Now...

1907
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:35,497
Now call him up, be nice to him.

1908
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:38,083
You know, I don't know, talk or something.

1909
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:39,876
-Why can't you do that?
-I can't.

1910
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:40,794
Why not?

1911
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:43,797
I can't.

1912
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:49,678
Doesn't work that way between us.

1913
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:52,431
Please, don't get hurt, Nick.

1914
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:57,394
I was one of the first Black mayors
of a major city in this county.

1915
01:36:57,937 --> 01:37:01,732
Lot of media pressure, millions of people
affected by my decisions.

1916
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:05,444
But there was no way l could turn my back
on the people who put me in.

1917
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:07,904
So I brought some of them along with me.

1918
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:10,532
Some of them messed up.

1919
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:14,411
Well, they're only people. They're human.

1920
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:17,664
I let it go at first
because l didn't believe it,

1921
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:20,625
and then because
I didn't want to believe it,

1922
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:23,712
and finally because
we would lose more ground

1923
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,589
by cleaning house in public

1924
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:27,758
than by sweeping it under the carpet.

1925
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,802
Took 1 2 years
for all that to catch up to me.

1926
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:33,889
That's a pretty nice run,
the way things go these days.

1927
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:36,558
You decided not to run again?

1928
01:37:36,642 --> 01:37:39,561
There were three grand jury indictments
hanging over my head.

1929
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,939
If I'd stood for another term,
a lot of people would've gone down,

1930
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,733
and I would've gone down with them.

1931
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:48,487
So I should lie,
and hope for 1 2 good years?

1932
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:50,364
This isn't the Old Testament, Wynn.

1933
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:53,867
People didn't vote you in
so you can test your moral fiber.

1934
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:56,161
If you're going to be a leader, lead.

1935
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:59,081
Take it to the man every chance you get.

1936
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:03,085
-It's not about a fight with white people.
-It's always about that, Wynn.

1937
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:06,088
If it isn't,
you're just another ward heeler.

1938
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:08,173
You don't defend anything.

1939
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:10,384
You attack what's wrong.

1940
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:12,803
That's what a leader is.

1941
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:23,188
I worked so hard to get on the council,
I never thought about...

1942
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:26,608
Can't know how you'll play the green
while you're still back at the tee, Wynn.

1943
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,653
You just figure it out when you get there.

1944
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:37,369
[Riggs] Hey, Nick?

1945
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,543
Figured you might be here.

1946
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:47,963
This was always your favorite hiding spot.

1947
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:50,215
What do you want?

1948
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:53,927
To see if you needed help.

1949
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:59,266
What do you wanna help me for?

1950
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:05,897
Your brother must have saved my ass
a half-dozen times over there.

1951
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:07,232
And then your father.

1952
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:11,236
When I got back, l was pretty messed up.
This job has been...

1953
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,822
-Look, you don't owe me nothing.
-All right.

1954
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,284
The offer stands though.

1955
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:19,744
You need money?

1956
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:21,997
A go-between?

1957
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:26,126
-After your friends thrown you in...
-Who said that?

1958
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:29,796
The guard saw me.
What are you talking about?

1959
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:33,550
The cop that came by here just said,

1960
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:35,844
"His pal threw him in."

1961
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:39,931
Carl.

1962
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:42,184
Fucking Carl.

1963
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:46,480
-What are you gonna do, Nicky?
-I gotta find something out.

1964
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:48,940
Hey, thanks, man. l owe you one.

1965
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:51,276
Right.

1966
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,029
Fucking kid.

1967
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:56,531
[Wynn] How are your, uh...?

1968
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,659
How are your classes this year?

1969
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:01,369
They're fine.

1970
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,916
Sometimes I, uh, really miss it.

1971
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:10,086
The classroom, the faculty politics.

1972
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:11,630
Well, it's...

1973
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,258
It's all a bit tame now, isn't it?

1974
01:40:15,343 --> 01:40:17,886
I know why you're here, Wynn.
Let's get on with it.

1975
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:21,681
I understand why you want
to hold your ground on this thing.

1976
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:22,891
Oh?

1977
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:23,934
Why is that?

1978
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,353
Because you're telling the truth.

1979
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:29,523
But you're not gonna
go to bat for me, are you?

1980
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:32,984
This is not about what l think is right.

1981
01:40:33,069 --> 01:40:34,986
I have to represent the people in my ward.

1982
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:38,114
If I was Black and they were white,
would that stop you?

1983
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:40,325
There are two possibilities
as to what will happen.

1984
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:44,329
Number one, if you drop the charges,
a few of the people at school,

1985
01:40:44,413 --> 01:40:47,749
not the ones that you respect the most,
will whisper.

1986
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:50,210
"Where there's smoke, there's fire."

1987
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:51,503
That you're gay.

1988
01:40:52,338 --> 01:40:54,256
That you must have
made a move on those boys.

1989
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,800
Number two, if you push this thing,

1990
01:40:56,884 --> 01:41:00,637
those same accusations
come out in the press, in a court of law.

1991
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:02,514
You're labeled a homosexual

1992
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:03,974
and a racist.

1993
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:07,060
Finally it comes down
to your word against theirs,

1994
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:08,937
and it doesn't matter what the verdict is.

1995
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:11,064
Those same people
will still think you're guilty.

1996
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:14,234
Now...

1997
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:18,321
I can't stop any of that.

1998
01:41:19,115 --> 01:41:19,948
At all.

1999
01:41:24,704 --> 01:41:26,538
But if you do drop the charges,

2000
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:31,001
I will do everything I can
to make it a clean break.

2001
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:36,506
This stinks.

2002
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:39,217
To high heaven.

2003

Yeah, you.

2010
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:10,624
You fucking rolled over on me.

2011
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:13,418
That's not a very nice thing to say, Nick.

2012
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:17,797
The way l see it, you stuck your nose
where it wasn't invited.

2013
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:19,883
Then your two little friends fucked up,

2014
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:23,553
and even the dumbshit cops in this town
were smart enough to run you down for it.

They walked in the fucking door,
and you were ready to spill.

2018
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,523
You rolled over on me,
just like you did on Tony.

2019
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:37,734
Don't talk to me about that old shit.

2020
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:40,904
Your best fucking friend,
and you threw him in.

2021
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,490
You think he was a fucking hero,
don't you?

2022
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:44,407
Tony.

2023
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:46,368
He was a punk.

2024
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:49,954
Who do you think
was driving the fucking car that night?

2025
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:52,040
Who was driving shitfaced,

2026
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:54,376
went up on the curb, and hit that woman?

2027
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:57,671
Who ran away,
ran his little all-state ass away,

2028
01:42:57,755 --> 01:42:59,714
and left me there
with my leg all fucked up

2029
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:01,758
and that woman lying on the ground?

2030
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:03,677
That's bullshit.

2031
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:05,679
Ask your daddy, Nick.

2032
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:07,472
Ask him what went down.

2033
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,143
And get out of my way. I'm closing up.

2034
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:16,523
-That fire last night.
-What about the fucking fire?

2035
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:19,025
It was you, wasn't it? You did it.

2036
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:22,487
Like l said before, Nick,

2037
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:25,657
ask your daddy.

2038
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,951
You fucking liar.

2039
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,462
-[Carl] You fuck.
-[gun cocks]

2040
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,716
You finished, Nick?

2041
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:46,136
Because if you're not,
I'll blow your fucking brains out.

2042
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:54,310
[officers humming "Highway Patrol"]

2043
01:43:54,395 --> 01:43:56,938
[Mike]
If ever the laws of any state are broken,

2044
01:43:57,857 --> 01:44:01,526
a duly authorized organization
springs into action.

2045
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:04,654
We may be called the state police,

2046
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:09,617
the state troopers,
the militia, the rangers,

2047
01:44:09,702 --> 01:44:12,579
or the highway patrol. [laughs]

2048
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:16,791
These are the stories of the brave men

2049
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:21,045
whose training, skill, and courage

2050
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:23,798
have preserved and enforced...

2051
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:27,218
Have enforced
and preserved our state laws.

2052
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:29,304
[officers applauding and whistling]

2053
01:44:32,892 --> 01:44:33,808
Thank you.

2054
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:37,312
Gentlemen, brothers of the shield,

2055
01:44:38,314 --> 01:44:39,397
I salute you.

2056
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,693
And I bid you farewell.

2057
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:46,696
[officers applauding]

2058
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:48,114
You can't walk, kid.

2059
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:51,201
Who needs a wife when you got
this fucking guy on your case?

2060
01:44:51,869 --> 01:44:53,369
Ten-four, brothers.

2061
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:54,913
Take care.

2062
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:57,874
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-[Mike] Yeah, yeah.

2063
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,250
-[Paddy] Early.
-[Mike] All right.

2064
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:00,460
-[O'Brien] Hey, Mikey.
-Hey.

2065
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:04,422
Jerry, stand them up. A round of drinks
for all these lousy beat walkers here.

2066
01:45:04,507 --> 01:45:06,508
[officers cheer]

2067
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:09,093
You hit the lottery, O'Brien?

2068
01:45:09,178 --> 01:45:12,847
I'm moving up to the DA's office.
Special investigator.

2069
01:45:12,932 --> 01:45:14,474
That's great to hear.

2070
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:16,976
All those years sucking up to the pols.

2071
01:45:17,603 --> 01:45:19,604
I'd hate to think there's no payoff.

2072
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:24,108
Everybody drinks but him.

2073
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:33,451
I don't see why
I gotta say all that again.

2074
01:45:34,119 --> 01:45:36,704
People have to hear it
with their own ears.

2075
01:45:36,789 --> 01:45:38,248
I don't like saying it.

2076
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,209
You ain't got nothing
to be ashamed of, do you?

2077
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:43,753
Part about him trying to touch me.

2078
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,509
-Did he touch you?
-No.

2079
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:53,847
You know, you can tell me.

2080
01:45:55,975 --> 01:45:58,059
It don't mean a thing about you if he did.

2081
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,269
No.

2082
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:02,480
But he did try to?

2083
01:46:02,565 --> 01:46:04,399
No. I...

2084
01:46:04,483 --> 01:46:05,775
I mean, yes.

2085
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:13,533
Desmond, what's the one thing
I tell you the most?

2086
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:15,410
The one thing.

2087
01:46:16,161 --> 01:46:17,287
Be a man.

2088
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:18,204
What?

2089
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:21,040
Be a man.

2090
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:22,458
And how you do that?

2091
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:24,836
-Stand up for yourself.
-No.

2092
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,046
You stand up for what is right.

2093
01:46:32,261 --> 01:46:36,764
I'd dive down into hell to keep you safe,
but you gotta be straight with me.

2094
01:46:38,017 --> 01:46:40,977
Now I'm gonna ask you one last time, okay?

2095
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:45,982
[indistinct chatter]

2096
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:51,279
Wynn.

2097
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:52,447
Excuse me.

2098
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:54,824
-Hi.
-Hi.

2099
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:56,743
-You talk to him?
-Uh-huh.

2100
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,036
Did you believe him?

2101
01:46:58,579 --> 01:46:59,412
Yes.

2102
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:01,664
What are you gonna do?

2103
01:47:02,499 --> 01:47:06,461
All right, if everybody would please
just grab a chair and sit down.

2104
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:09,923
We're just waiting on Jeanette Price
and her son.

2105
01:47:10,007 --> 01:47:12,008
[chatter continues]

2106
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:16,554
We can get started now.

2107
01:47:23,103 --> 01:47:25,313
It's nice to see all
of you concerned people here tonight.

2108
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:27,315
-I appreciate your support.
-[chatter stops]

2109
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:30,318
We have a lot to talk about tonight.

2110
01:47:30,402 --> 01:47:32,820
Desmond Price. Tito Rollins.

2111
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:35,949
Two of our young men
have been accused of a serious crime.

2112
01:47:36,033 --> 01:47:37,784
I've had all the charges dropped.

2113
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,828
Their names will not appear
on any criminal record.

2114
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:51,255
The root of the problem was
another overreaction by the police force.

2115
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:54,342
At the next council meeting,
I will present a demand

2116
01:47:54,426 --> 01:47:58,846
for a Civilian Review Board to investigate
the death of Hollis Washington,

2117
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,724
and several other incidents
in the past year.

2118
01:48:01,809 --> 01:48:03,309
But more importantly,

2119
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:06,729
more importantly,
we had a fire last night.

2120
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:09,941
Thirteen of our families
were left homeless,

2121
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:14,821
and resulted in the death
of a young woman and her 3-month-old baby.

2122
01:48:14,905 --> 01:48:18,491
-[indistinct chatter]
-The city's response to this was pitiful.

2123
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:22,286
Instead of finding temporary shelters
and rehabilitating those apartments,

2124
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:26,666
the city is pushing through a deal
to knock them down and replace them

2125
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:29,752
with a high-income condominium
and a shopping mall.

2126
01:48:29,837 --> 01:48:30,878
[groaning]

2127
01:48:30,963 --> 01:48:33,923
When they needed our rent,
they jammed us in there,

2128
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,759
they didn't turn the heat on,
they didn't collect the garbage,

2129
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:38,386
they didn't provide street lights,

2130
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,055
or police protection,
or any of the other services

2131
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:43,933
we should've expected
as residents of this city.

2132
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:47,270
But now, now,

2133
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:49,981
now that they can smell a profit,

2134
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:54,277
they want to burn us out
and plow us under.

2135
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:55,653
[crowd groaning]

2136
01:48:55,738 --> 01:48:58,990
They want to drive a wedge
through this community,

2137
01:48:59,074 --> 01:49:00,700
cut us up to pieces,

2138
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:03,077
until we dry up and blow away.

2139
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:06,873
See, l know what they're thinking.
I know what they're thinking.

2140
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:09,792
They're thinking that
we are just a bunch of poor people,

2141
01:49:09,877 --> 01:49:12,754
a bunch of Black people
and Hispanic people,

2142
01:49:12,838 --> 01:49:16,716
people who just got off the boat
and can't get it together down here.

2143
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,968
People who don't even know
how to work together.

2144
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:20,261
People who don't care,

2145
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:23,556
people who don't count,
and people who don't even vote.

2146
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,851
So I'm gonna ask you right now,
are we gonna prove them right?

2147
01:49:26,935 --> 01:49:28,227
No.

2148
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:30,438
Are we gonna lie down and take this?

2149
01:49:30,522 --> 01:49:31,731
No.

2150
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:35,485
Are we gonna allow them to push us around,
shut us down, and burn us out?

2151
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:37,195
No.

2152
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:39,906
Well, you know,

2153
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:45,411
just three blocks from here, up the hill,

2154
01:49:46,288 --> 01:49:50,625
the mayor and four councilmen
are attending a dinner

2155
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:53,836
to raise funds
for next November's campaign.

2156
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:55,797
[dismayed chatter]

2157
01:49:55,881 --> 01:49:58,549
Now, we were not invited.

2158
01:49:58,634 --> 01:50:01,010
Now, l think we ought to go up there,

2159
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:04,555
and let the mayor know
just how left out we feel.

2160
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,973
-Don't you?
-Yeah.

2161
01:50:09,228 --> 01:50:13,189
I think we ought to go up there
and tell the mayor

2162
01:50:13,273 --> 01:50:16,067
that if he don't get
his act together real fast,

2163
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:20,154
he's the one who's gonna be left out
of the city hall next election.

2164
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:21,864
-[man 1] All right.
-Let's do it.

2165
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:26,619
-[man 2] Yes, sir.
-[man 3] Right on.

2166
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:28,830
[excited chatter]

2167
01:50:28,914 --> 01:50:31,457
-Is everybody behind me?
-They're coming, baby. All of them.

2168
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:34,502
-I hope I've got the address right.
-What are we going to do?

2169
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:36,504
We'll figure that out when we get there.

2170
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:41,968
-[woman] Come on.
-[man] Yeah.

2171
01:50:42,052 --> 01:50:45,054
-[rock music playing in bar]
-[crowd clamoring]

2172
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:09,954
I have fought at the municipal level

2173
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:13,541
to provide corporate tax incentives

2174
01:51:14,293 --> 01:51:16,752
to lure industry back to our city.

2175
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:21,883
I have fought at the state
and federal levels for funding

2176
01:51:21,967 --> 01:51:23,718
to rebuild our roads,

2177
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:25,511
to light our streets,

2178
01:51:25,596 --> 01:51:30,016
to keep the police
and firefighting forces up to strength.

2179
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,059
But more importantly,

2180
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:34,729
and this I take particular pride in,

2181
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:39,192
I have fought against
the environmental alarmists

2182
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:41,736
and the special interest groups

2183
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:47,116
that would block important developments,
like the Galaxy Tower complex,

2184
01:51:47,993 --> 01:51:51,871
which promise to revitalize our economy

2185
01:51:51,955 --> 01:51:54,415
and put our city back on the map.

2186
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:57,710
And I intend to keep up this fight.

2187
01:51:58,462 --> 01:51:59,670
And with your help,

2188
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:02,089
we will once more

2189
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:04,717
be a city with a future,

2190
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:06,928
a city on the move.

2191
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:09,805
Truly, a city of hope.

2192
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:11,891
[guests applauding]

2193
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:20,816
[indistinct chatter]

2194
01:52:26,949 --> 01:52:29,116
I've brought some concerned citizens.

2195
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:31,202
[cheering and whooping]

2196
01:52:34,706 --> 01:52:37,625
-They've been looking for you, Mr. Mayor.
-[woman] Yeah, mayor.

2197
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:39,752
You got a minute?

2198
01:52:43,382 --> 01:52:45,383
[basketball bouncing]

2199
01:52:51,807 --> 01:52:52,723
[Franklin] Little help?

2200
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:58,104
Thanks.

2201
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:01,607
[Nick] Just getting out of work?

2202
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:04,360
No, just going in.

2203
01:53:06,405 --> 01:53:08,864
-It's a tough gig, the night shift.
-Yeah.

2204
01:53:09,825 --> 01:53:12,410
Ugh! Your hand's messed up.

2205
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:16,580
My life is messed up. This is nothing.

2206
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:19,542
-You play?
-Nah, I suck.

2207
01:53:24,548 --> 01:53:28,301
My brother used to try to teach me.
He was the real thing.

2208
01:53:29,052 --> 01:53:31,220
All-State guard. Big deal.

2209
01:53:34,433 --> 01:53:35,725
Play around here?

2210
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:36,642
Sacred Heart.

2211
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:38,561
Tony Rinaldi.

2212
01:53:39,604 --> 01:53:42,940
Oh, snap. Tony the Tiger. Yeah.

2213
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:45,526
I played against that dude.
Sucker was bad.

2214
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:49,780
Fire up those Cazzie Russell jumpers,
no arc, bam, bam, bam.

2215
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:52,199
Kill you with that jump shot.

2216
01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:57,705
Where'd he play in college?

2217
01:53:57,789 --> 01:53:59,165
Marines got him.

2218
01:53:59,249 --> 01:54:01,459
Yeah? He go over?

2219
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:02,501
Uh-huh.

2220
01:54:03,295 --> 01:54:05,171
[sighs] l did that.

2221
01:54:07,424 --> 01:54:08,341
Infantry.

2222
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:12,053
He make it back okay?

2223
01:54:12,929 --> 01:54:13,763
Nah.

2224
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:19,810
Nice ball-handler too.
He was fast for a white guy.

2225
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:22,605
Not fast enough.

2226
01:54:26,568 --> 01:54:27,526
Hey, look, l, uh...

2227
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:29,779
I gotta run.

2228
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:32,782
-Take it easy.
-Yeah, you too.

2229
01:54:38,038 --> 01:54:39,538
Tony the Tiger.

2230
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:43,209
What a waste.

2231
01:54:45,212 --> 01:54:47,838
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2232
01:54:47,923 --> 01:54:50,925
Why settle for less
when you can have it all? Why?

2233
01:54:51,009 --> 01:54:52,885
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2234
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:54,595
You can have it... Why?

2235
01:54:54,679 --> 01:54:56,972
Why? Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2236
01:54:57,057 --> 01:54:57,890
Angela Sabino.

2237
01:54:57,974 --> 01:55:00,559
Why settle for less
when you can have it all? You can have it.

2238
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:02,603
Yeah, but she might be out front.

2239
01:55:03,688 --> 01:55:07,775
Well, just tell her that I got hung up,
but I'm on my way, all right?

2240
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:08,692
Thanks.

2241
01:55:18,537 --> 01:55:20,621
Rinaldi. l got a want on you, punk.

2242
01:55:20,705 --> 01:55:21,831
Yeah, stick it up your ass.

2243
01:55:21,915 --> 01:55:23,833
-I'm not playing around, asshole.
-Hey!

2244
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:26,252
You don't have your little cop suit on.

2245
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,028
[car tires screech]

2246
01:55:56,366 --> 01:55:57,825
[tires screech]

2247
01:55:57,909 --> 01:56:00,035
[Fuentes] Freeze. Lay it down, pal.

2248
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:03,080
It's me, you fucks. Mike Rizzo.

2249
01:56:03,165 --> 01:56:04,874
You're letting that cocksucker get away.

2250
01:56:06,293 --> 01:56:09,712
It's all right. He's one of ours.
What's the fireworks for?

2251
01:56:09,796 --> 01:56:12,339
Had a suspect try to take my head off.

2252
01:56:12,424 --> 01:56:15,384
-Armed?
-He hit me with a fucking garbage pail.

2253
01:56:15,469 --> 01:56:18,012
Assault with a deadly trash receptacle.

2254
01:56:18,096 --> 01:56:20,014
-[laughing]
-Yeah, fuck you.

2255
01:56:20,891 --> 01:56:22,266
Come on, let's get him.

2256
01:56:25,854 --> 01:56:29,106
It's that punk, Nick Rinaldi.
We're supposed to pick him up.

2257
01:56:29,649 --> 01:56:32,568
-They called the dogs off on that guy.
-What?

2258
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:34,862
He got a clean bill this afternoon.
Where were you?

2259
01:56:34,946 --> 01:56:38,365
That piece of yours,
is it private, or on loan from the job?

2260
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:39,825
It's mine.

2261
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:41,911
-You been drinking, Mike?
-What the fuck?

2262
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:44,246
-You didn't hit him, did you?
-He resisted arrest.

2263
01:56:44,331 --> 01:56:46,582
He wasn't wanted.
Did you read him the book first?

2264
01:56:46,666 --> 01:56:47,917
He's a piece of shit.

2265
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:49,752
-[Paddy] Did you hit him?
-I don't know.

2266
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:51,462
[Paddy sighs]

2267
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:59,512
We could say we were there in time to see,
and then he went after you...

2268
01:56:59,596 --> 01:57:01,680
Hey, Paddy, I'm not going for this.

2269
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:04,767
-If this happened to you...
-I'd deserve to get kicked off the force.

2270
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:07,394
Accidents happen, kid.
We gotta close ranks here.

2271
01:57:07,479 --> 01:57:09,313
I'm not going for it, period.

2272
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,107
You're not gonna back me up?

2273
01:57:13,818 --> 01:57:15,778
He's my partner.
What am I gonna do, shoot him?

2274
01:57:15,862 --> 01:57:17,404
Paddy, you know me.

2275
01:57:17,989 --> 01:57:20,074
You better hand your piece up here, Mike.

2276
01:57:21,409 --> 01:57:23,118
Oh, I don't believe this.

2277
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:25,454
I don't believe you fucking guys.

2278
01:57:25,539 --> 01:57:27,581
What happens if he dies?
What happens to me?

2279
01:57:27,666 --> 01:57:28,499
Mike,

2280
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,461
do you believe in a supreme being?

2281
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:41,720
How'd you find me here?

2282
01:57:41,805 --> 01:57:44,598
I saw your address in the police report.

2283
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:45,683
What do you want?

2284
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:47,851
I want to talk.

2285
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:49,770
Forget it.

2286
01:57:49,854 --> 01:57:50,688
Come on, man.

2287
01:57:50,772 --> 01:57:51,689
What?

2288
01:57:51,773 --> 01:57:52,606
You won.

2289
01:57:53,441 --> 01:57:55,109
Great. You wanna rub it in?

2290
01:57:55,819 --> 01:57:57,695
I'm sorry we fucked you up.

2291
01:57:57,779 --> 01:57:58,779
Little late for sorry.

2292
01:57:58,863 --> 01:58:00,948
I know you're not a faggot.

2293
01:58:02,450 --> 01:58:03,534
[sighs]

2294
01:58:03,618 --> 01:58:05,661
We got a long way to go, don't we?

2295
01:58:06,997 --> 01:58:09,331
Look, l gotta run.

2296
01:58:12,794 --> 01:58:15,129
You mind if I hang with you a minute?

2297
01:58:15,213 --> 01:58:16,422
It's a free country.

2298
01:58:16,965 --> 01:58:19,091
-Where'd you hear that one?
-[laughs]

2299
01:58:20,135 --> 01:58:22,052
-You're a teacher, huh?
-Yeah.

2300
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:23,220
What do you teach?

2301
01:58:24,014 --> 01:58:25,598
Urban relations.

2302
01:58:25,682 --> 01:58:27,016
Yeah? What's that?

2303
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:30,102
[blues music playing]

2304
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:10,851
[music fades]

2305
01:59:11,478 --> 01:59:12,811
[clattering]

2306
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,771
Who's that?

2307
01:59:14,939 --> 01:59:15,773
Nick?

2308
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:17,941
Are you up there?

2309
01:59:49,349 --> 01:59:51,308
Riggs told me l might find you here.

2310
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,228
I needed a place to rest.

2311
01:59:56,398 --> 01:59:58,399
I've been worried about you.

2312
01:59:58,483 --> 01:59:59,483
[laughs]

2313
02:00:00,985 --> 02:00:01,819
Worried?

2314
02:00:04,072 --> 02:00:06,699
Worried about what,
that the cops would pick me up?

2315
02:00:07,242 --> 02:00:09,159
Make you look bad in the papers?

2316
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:11,328
I don't know.

2317
02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:14,832
You rob a place
that belongs to a family friend.

2318
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:16,542
I mean, what is that?

2319
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:19,086
What, you need money?

2320
02:00:21,005 --> 02:00:22,715
You need money, you come to me.

2321
02:00:23,299 --> 02:00:24,925
And how do you make your money?

2322
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:26,218
I don't steal it.

2323
02:00:26,302 --> 02:00:27,136
No?

2324
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:34,226
I swore this wasn't gonna happen to you.

2325
02:00:35,145 --> 02:00:36,395
Not after Tony.

2326
02:00:38,064 --> 02:00:40,190
I was gonna look after you.

2327
02:00:40,275 --> 02:00:41,108
How?

2328
02:00:41,735 --> 02:00:44,611
By chasing me into the Marines,
like you did with him?

2329
02:00:44,696 --> 02:00:48,073
They were drunk and they stole a car.

2330
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:51,410
And they hit somebody,
and they left them in the street.

2331
02:00:52,912 --> 02:00:54,872
He wasn't a hero, Nick.

2332
02:00:56,541 --> 02:00:58,125
He ran away from it.

2333
02:00:59,085 --> 02:01:00,794
And he came to me,

2334
02:01:00,879 --> 02:01:04,089
and he wanted me to cover for him.

2335
02:01:05,383 --> 02:01:07,050
I took him to the station.

2336
02:01:09,179 --> 02:01:12,973
Yeah, down to all your pals.

2337
02:01:13,057 --> 02:01:15,726
Nick, they would've found out.

2338
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:19,938
They had the woman in the hospital
with a broken back.

2339
02:01:20,815 --> 02:01:24,443
And his pal, Carl, in the hospital,
ready to spill his guts.

2340
02:01:27,447 --> 02:01:29,156
I did the best l could.

2341
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:32,159
I got Tony a choice.

2342
02:01:34,287 --> 02:01:36,705
The service or jail.

2343
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:39,041
Some fucking choice.

2344
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:41,960
You think you get through this life
without making choices like that?

2345
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:43,712
You told him to go.

2346
02:01:44,422 --> 02:01:45,422
[sighs]

2347
02:01:48,927 --> 02:01:50,302
All my life,

2348
02:01:51,721 --> 02:01:55,516
I thought that l was the one in control.

2349
02:01:56,976 --> 02:01:59,186
I made sure l had the juice.

2350
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:01,897
I had all the angles.

2351
02:02:05,527 --> 02:02:06,735
Jesus.

2352
02:02:08,530 --> 02:02:10,948
I'm not in control of a damn thing.

2353
02:02:11,658 --> 02:02:13,575
Did you come here to turn me in?

2354
02:02:14,244 --> 02:02:15,953
Nobody's after you, Nick.

2355
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:20,916
I took care of that. [chuckles]

2356
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:21,834
How?

2357
02:02:25,296 --> 02:02:27,089
I talked to some people and...

2358
02:02:27,841 --> 02:02:29,174
You did a favor.

2359
02:02:30,844 --> 02:02:31,677
Yeah.

2360
02:02:33,805 --> 02:02:35,055
I did a favor.

2361
02:02:36,099 --> 02:02:38,559
You had Carl burn down L Street.

2362
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:41,103
Nicky, they were coming after you.

2363
02:02:43,064 --> 02:02:46,191
They weren't gonna give you any choices.

2364
02:02:47,443 --> 02:02:48,277
Daddy.

2365
02:02:49,696 --> 02:02:52,114
Those people, they burned up in there.

2366
02:02:53,116 --> 02:02:57,661
I saw when they brought them out,
a girl and a little baby.

2367
02:02:57,745 --> 02:02:59,371
I let them do it.

2368
02:03:01,499 --> 02:03:04,001
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2369
02:03:04,794 --> 02:03:06,211
I let them do it.

2370
02:03:11,509 --> 02:03:12,593
[Nick groans]

2371
02:03:16,014 --> 02:03:16,847
Daddy?

2372
02:03:18,016 --> 02:03:20,183
I'm fucked up over here.

2373
02:03:23,688 --> 02:03:26,815
-Nick, you're bleeding.
-Daddy.

2374
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:29,192
My life is such a fucking mess.

2375
02:03:29,277 --> 02:03:31,028
Hold on, I'll get help.

2376
02:03:31,112 --> 02:03:32,446
No, no, no.

2377
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:34,740
Stay with me, please? Stay with me.

2378
02:03:34,824 --> 02:03:36,617
Please? Don't leave me here alone.

2379
02:03:36,701 --> 02:03:38,160
Okay. All right.

2380
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:40,329
-I'm scared.
