1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,837
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,868
(dramatic music continues)

3
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,419
(instrumental music)

4
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,885
(dramatic music)

5
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,349
(knuckles rapping)

6
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,935
(door clicks)

7
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,356
(door clicks)

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,525
I'm Mark Sheldon sir,
reporting for duty.

9
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,193
Oh, yes, glad to meet you, Mark.

10
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,194
Have a nice trip?

11
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,530
Well, I lost a lot of sleep
worrying about this meeting.

12
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,574
(chuckles) Yes, I
felt the same way myself

13
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,200
the first time I reported for duty.

14
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,952
But I got over it, so will you.

15
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,788
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

16
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,583
Now, we'll have our first
and possibly our last talk.

17
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,711
How's everything in Kansas City?

18
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,254
Fine, thanks.

19
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,798
You, uh, you know what
you getting into, Mark?

20
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,716
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,843
In joining our under cover staff,

22
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,595
you'll have to burn all
your bridges behind you.

23
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:36,971
I've done that, sir.

24
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,598
You're joining an army.

25
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,558
An army, where there are no banners,

26
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,018
no medals for heroism,

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,478
and death is the only
honourable discharge.

28
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,521
When you walk out of that door

29
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,982
you're starting on a lonely road.

30
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,026
You get into trouble, we won't help you.

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,194
We'll deny that you're one of our men.

32
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,070
I understand.

33
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,700
Well, I'd hoped you
would let me talk you out.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,704
(drawer rattles)

35
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,080
Your full instructions.

36
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,542
Of course, you'll have to
use various names from now on

37
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,794
depending upon where and
what you are working on.

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,671
Now, with us you will
always have a number.

39
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,507
It'll never change, remember, 64.

40
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,801
64.

41
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,638
[Man] Your opposite number will be 46.

42
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,097
My opposite number?

43
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,183
Yes, you see, wouldn't
be fair or even sensible

44
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,518
to send you out on your
first assignment alone.

45
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,312
Now, 46 is been with us a long time,

46
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,189
he's a good man, you'll like him.

47
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,357
May I ask what he's working on?

48
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,400
Well, I won't know
until his work is finished

49
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,735
and he's made his report.

50
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,822
You, uh, you can still change your mind.

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,910
All right, good luck, 64.

52
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,620
Thank you, sir.

53
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,747
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

54
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,707
I, Mark Sheldon do solemnly swear.

55
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,585
I, Mark Sheldon do solemnly swear.

56
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,844
(footsteps tapping)

57
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,438
(knuckles rapping)

58
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,983
(door clicks)

59
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,027
What do you want?
The office is closed.

60
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,780
It's too bad.
I came a long way to talk business.

61
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,407
A long way?

62
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,659
Kansas City, by way of Washington.

63
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,452
Oh, uh, come in.

64
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,249
(door clicks)

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,834
All right, what is it you want?

66
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,837
Wanna find out the market
price of National Debentures.

67
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,672
Those Washington specials.

68
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,465
-Are you a stockholder?
-Yes.

69
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,842
For how long?

70
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,802
Since last Tuesday night at 9:46.

71
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,011
How many shares do you own?

72
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,263
64.

73
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,514
How many do you wanna buy?

74
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,765
46.

75
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,684
I have exactly 46.

76
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,602
I think we can make a deal.

77
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,855
Certainly glad you got here.
(door clicks)

78
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,314
Let's go into my office,
we'll get acquainted.

79
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,735
(footsteps tapping)

80
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,530
(door thuds)
Well, you ready to go to work?

81
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,741
-Yes, sir.
-Now look, we're partners.

82
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,576
None of that sir business with me.

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,827
Come on, sit down.

84
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,163
(footsteps tapping)

85
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,165
I've been working on
this case for six months.

86
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,374
I've got a lot of information

87
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,085
but so far I haven't been
able to prove a thing.

88
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,420
Now, I'll tell you one thing.

89
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,047
You and I are gonna try to
smash the dirtiest racket

90
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,507
any man ever invented.

91
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,967
Don't tell me there's a new racket?

92
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,136
Yeah, right here.

93
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,599
That is an island, Dead Man's Island.

94
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,517
And a very good name for it too.

95
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,686
It's United States
territory but it's so small

96
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,647
and unimportant nobody
pays any attention to it.

97
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,692
Except the man we're after, he owns it.

98
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,570
Did you ever hear of a
man by the name of Danel,

99
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,696
Stephen Danel?

100
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,157
I don't think so.

101
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,536
Well, Stephen Danel is our
man, Lincoln freed the slaves.

102
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,874
Mr. Danel is back in the trade,
doing very well at it too.

103
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,042
[Mark] What's his nationality?

104
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,794
I don't know, might be anything.

105
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,797
He's an American citizen now
and that makes him our problem.

106
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,673
He deals in paroled men.

107
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,426
Convicts, who think he's giving
them a new start in life.

108
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:06,180
But what they really get
is a slow, living death.

109
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,432
(gunshot bangs)

110
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,142
(gun thuds)

111
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,645
(body thuds)

112
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,565
(blinds rattles)

113
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,026
(ladder clatters)

114
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,736
(gunshots banging)

115
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,112
Stop it,
(gunshot bangs)

116
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,531
Stop shooting.

117
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,032
(gun thuds)

118
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,409
(bell clangs)

119
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,411
Hello, hello.
Information?

120
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,496
Get away from that telephone.

121
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
Don't you know any better than that?

122
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,624
You've got to have a doctor.

123
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,917
Beat it, the fire escape.

124
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,211
If they catch you in
here, spoil everything.

125
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,630
Remember, Danel.

126
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,049
Good luck.
(body thuds)

127
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,555
(crowd chattering)

128
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,558
(door clattering)

129
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,310
[Officer] Get back.

130
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,104
Get back, come on.

131
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,313
Get back now.

132
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,650
(crowd chattering)

133
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,194
All right, stand back.
Will you please?

134
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,321
(footsteps tapping)

135
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,489
Get back.

136
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,241
(glass shattering)
Watch it.

137
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,704
All right, stand back there.

138
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,539
Get back, get back.

139
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,543
(door clicks)

140
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,341
(blinds rattling)

141
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,970
(footsteps tapping)

142
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,513
Come on, come on.

143
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,181
Why did you kill him?

144
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,266
-I didn't.
-Then who did?

145
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,934
I wish I knew.

146
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,686
Who are you?
What's your name?

147
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,773
Okay, we'll find out.

148
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,358
Your fingerprints are on that gun.

149
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,860
I told you I used that gun.

150
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,737
Shooting at whoever
was on the fire escape.

151
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,660
You burnt something here, what?

152
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,538
That's my business.

153
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,749
[Man] You admit you were
here when this guy was killed?

154
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,666
Yes.

155
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,960
All right.

156
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,962
You're locked in this office with the guy,

157
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,047
he gets shot in the back.

158
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,882
Your fingerprints are
on the gun, nobody else's,

159
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,300
we catch you trying to make a getaway.

160
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,969
-That's right.
-And you didn't kill him?

161
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,347
-No.
-And you haven't got a name.

162
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,601
If you want a name, make it John Smith.

163
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,021
All right, wise guy.

164
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,398
Maybe you'll change your story tomorrow.

165
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,692
Come on, Mr. Smith.

166
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,822
(crowd chattering)

167
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:29,907
What happened, sir?

168
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,408
A guy just killed somebody.

169
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,743
Shot him down like a dog.

170
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,286
Oh, but that's shocking, isn't it?

171
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,455
They're bringing him out now.

172
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,125
Say, I never saw a
murderer before, did you?

173
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,960
No.

174
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,378
All right folks, break
it up, let him get out.

175
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,671
Break it up, come on, get out.

176
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,755
Back up, get off.

177
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,882
All right, come on, get back you.

178
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,969
(footsteps tapping)

179
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,446
Is everything okay?

180
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,364
Of course.

181
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,951
Police just took the
unfortunate gentleman away.

182
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,455
Why should an old story affect
you so deeply, Mr. Brand?

183
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,627
This were the first time
but, uh, of course, it isn't.

184
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,879
Chicago was the first time, wasn't it?

185
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,966
And then San Francisco?

186
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,343
(match hisses)

187
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,722
You ought to do something
about your nervous condition, Mr. Brand.

188
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,351
(Stephen blows)

189
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,188
Nervous men sometimes talk too
much and they make mistakes.

190
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,816
And you mustn't make mistakes, Mr. Brand.

191
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,568
And you must never talk too much.

192
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,904
But I got a right to
know what's happened.

193
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,323
Oh, yes, of course.

194
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,075
You see, Mr. Brand,

195
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,493
the man who was so interested

196
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,663
in my personal affairs is quite dead.

197
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,791
And a gentleman who came
to see him is under arrest

198
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,793
for murder. (chuckles)

199
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,253
But maybe know something.

200
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,089
You don't have to worry about that.

201
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,425
I'll watch this case.

202
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,761
Good night, Mr. Brand

203
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,514
and, uh, pleasant dreams.

204
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,272
(door clicks)

205
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,610
(door thuds)

206
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,948
(dramatic music)

207
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,753
Before imposing sentence I
must say to you, John Smith,

208
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,923
I feel as I'm sure the jurors felt

209
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,967
that much of the real story of
your crime is not been told.

210
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:59,098
And I must add that your
refusal to tell the true story

211
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,643
to identify yourself or to
offer any believable defence

212
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,687
probably had much to do
with the jury's verdict.

213
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,314
No evidence was introduced to show

214
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,275
there was any gain for you
in the crime you committed.

215
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,528
The peculiar circumstances of this case

216
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,864
justify the jury in returning
a verdict of guilty.

217
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,616
Under the law, I must sentence you

218
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,993
to be committed to the State Penitentiary

219
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,872
and there to serve a term
of from one to 20 years.

220
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,625
Have you any statement you
wish to make to this court?

221
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,336
[Mark] I have nothing to say.

222
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,215
(gavel thudding)

223
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,009
(dramatic music)

224
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,469
(footsteps tapping)

225
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,472
(hammers thudding)

226
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,065
(hammers thudding)

227
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,370
(stones clattering)

228
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,040
(dramatic music continues)

229
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,893
(prisoners chattering)

230
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,257
We're all set, Mr. Danel.

231
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,468
Thank you, Captain.

232
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,402
I trust you understand why it is necessary

233
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,987
to punish this young man.

234
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,700
Where men live and work together
discipline is essential.

235
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,746
Quite essential and, uh,

236
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,125
sometimes an object
lesson becomes necessary

237
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,377
as it has today.

238
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,464
Unfortunately, this is causing all of us

239
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,800
to lose valuable time from our work.

240
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,845
20 lashes, Captain.
-Yes, sir.

241
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,559
Eddie, I hope I'll hear good reports

242
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,186
on your conduct hereafter.

243
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,855
Come, Doctor.

244
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,283
(whip cracking)
(Eddie whimpering)

245
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,995
(birds chirping)

246
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,083
(gate clicks)
(footsteps tapping)

247
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,892
Oh, come on, shake
hands, now shake hands.

248
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,020
Come on, give me your
hand, give me your hand.

249
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,354
[Stephen] Siggy.

250
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,480
Yes, sir.

251
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,026
Don't you have any work
to do for Mrs. Danel?

252
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,610
(monkey chittering)

253
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,612
Keep that monkey away from me.

254
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,699
Yes, sir.

255
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,086
(door clicks)

256
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,674
(door clatters)

257
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,304
Very lovely, these flowers.

258
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,308
I had a very annoying afternoon.

259
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,146
Please Lorraine, put on something
else, I don't like that.

260
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,529
Then come back, I want you to play for me.

261
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,115
(glass clattering)

262
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,203
I wouldn't, if I were you.

263
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,290
(glass thuds)

264
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,001
(matches rattle)

265
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,169
Your hands, Doctor.

266
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,379
(fire crackles)

267
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,131
You really ought to keep yourself cleaner.

268
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,218
I'm sorry. (blows)

269
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,306
(drawer rattles)

270
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,934
You know, I am leaving for
the mainland tomorrow, Doctor.

271
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,185
Yes?

272
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,478
Yes.

273
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,731
To bring back some friends
I've kept track of.

274
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,483
Friends like Mr. Smith.

275
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,612
The young man is made repeated
applications for parole.

276
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,365
Naturally, he wants to get
out of prison, all convicts do

277
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,952
but, uh, in his case he
might've a special reason

278
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:12,869
for wanting out

279
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:17,666
and I think I ought to help
Mr. Smith to get his parole.

280
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,001
What do you think, Doctor?

281
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,256
Mr. Danel, I probably
shouldn't say this.

282
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,508
I don't want you to be
offended, but I wonder.

283
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,760
You're trying to say I should stop, uh,

284
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,763
shall we say, recruiting
paroled men for my island?

285
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,724
Yes, yes, it's dangerous.

286
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,602
Yes, very dangerous.

287
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,020
But not as dangerous, Doctor,

288
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,897
as if I were to employ ordinary workmen

289
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,150
who might be able to tell too much.

290
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,110
Also the work is very hard.

291
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,070
Men who could leave, would.

292
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,196
No, Doctor, I think,

293
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,032
for our purpose paroled
men are much better.

294
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,367
Men like yourself.

295
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,120
Yes, Mr. Danel.

296
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,165
I'm so glad you agree with me, Doctor.

297
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,668
Yes, Mr. Smith,

298
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,213
I shall talk to you very soon.

299
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,256
(door thuds)

300
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,387
(footsteps tapping)

301
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,394
You may go, Doctor.

302
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,444
(door clicks and thuds)

303
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,867
My favourite gown.

304
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,705
(piano gentle music)

305
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,834
And one of my favourite pieces of music.

306
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,840
How did you know I like
the "Nocturne" so well?

307
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,929
Oh, you told me, a long time ago.

308
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,267
I, I didn't wanna play it for you until,

309
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,394
until I was sure I knew it perfectly.

310
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,358
It's very thoughtful of you, Lorraine.

311
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,362
(gentle piano music continues)

312
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,001
You going away tomorrow, aren't you?

313
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,555
I wish I could go with you.

314
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,850
(gentle piano music continues)

315
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,489
I get so lonely when you're away.

316
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,117
Do you?

317
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,918
Please take me with you this time.

318
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,006
I remember when I saw you
the first time on the stage.

319
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,094
You were beautiful.

320
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,429
Very beautiful.

321
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,641
But your acting was
always unconvincing to me.

322
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,520
I can't stand staying here, I can't.

323
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,025
You afraid to take me
with you, I know too much.

324
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:30,942
Afraid?

325
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,194
But darling, don't you know

326
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,406
that a man's wife can
never testify against him?

327
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,366
And you are my wife.

328
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,326
Yes.

329
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,620
Because I was a fool.

330
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,039
Of course, you'd leave me if you could

331
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:48,251
once we reached the mainland
but I couldn't let you do that.

332
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,212
I need you here.

333
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,424
Remember when,

334
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,677
when you met me and told me

335
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,555
how much you'd love to leave
the stage and come with me?

336
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,391
Remember, Lorraine?

337
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,313
For rich and for poorer,
for better and for worse,

338
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,565
in sickness and in health.

339
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,275
Stop talking about it.

340
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,319
I don't regret my bargain, you do.

341
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,697
You must get over that.

342
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,741
This is your home and a man's wife

343
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,701
must always be in his
home and waiting for him,

344
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:22,619
isn't that right?

345
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,706
Lorraine, you mustn't walk
away when I'm talking to you.

346
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,710
(dramatic music)

347
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,090
Look, my dear.

348
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,720
The largest and finest diamond
ever found on my island.

349
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,555
I'm going to give it to you.

350
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,432
[Lorraine] I don't want it.

351
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,769
I know that, but I want you to have it.

352
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,564
You are enjoying this
so much, aren't you?

353
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,274
I'm a prisoner here.

354
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,152
You'll never let me leave, you don't dare.

355
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,697
All right, I'm here, aren't you satisfied?

356
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,656
Isn't that enough?

357
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,824
Stop torturing me.

358
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,703
(dramatic music)

359
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,248
(door thuds)

360
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,632
I believe in giving
deserving men decent jobs

361
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,634
in pleasant surroundings,

362
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,345
a chance to earn peace and contentment.

363
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,348
The men who work with me
are free of all the things

364
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,892
that make criminals out of paroled men.

365
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,938
I've gone over the list of
applicants before your board

366
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,275
and, uh, I'm especially
interested in a young man

367
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,027
who calls himself John Smith.

368
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,697
I ask you to parole him in my custody

369
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,532
and I promise you, gentlemen,

370
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,200
if you let him come with me

371
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,618
he'll never again be a burden

372
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,996
on your taxpayers or on society.

373
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:55,211
(plane engine revving)

374
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,216
Here gentlemen, is my little island.

375
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,773
You better fasten your belts.

376
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,321
(cart wheels rattling)

377
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,240
(hammers thudding)

378
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,117
(whistle blows)

379
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,036
(plane engine revving)

380
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,038
(whistle blows)

381
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,664
[Cort] Line up.

382
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,333
[Man] Line up.

383
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,293
Come on, come on.

384
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,671
Come on, out of there.

385
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:42,133
(plane engine revving)

386
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,266
(footsteps tapping)

387
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,774
What you want?

388
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,362
Mr. Danel will want you in
the picture with the new men.

389
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,199
-How many this time?
-Five.

390
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,578
And how long will they live?

391
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,250
(footsteps crunching)

392
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,836
One moment gentlemen.

393
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,337
We have no police on the island,

394
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,923
so one has to take certain precautions.

395
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,260
Oh, I wouldn't touch those
wires if I were you, Mr. Smith.

396
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,054
There's a slight electric
current passing through them.

397
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,223
To keep out the animals and snakes,

398
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,851
you see, the jungle comes
awfully close to us here.

399
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,727
Gentlemen.

400
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,856
(footsteps crunching)

401
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,942
(footsteps tapping)

402
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,320
(birds chirping)

403
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,698
My dear, I've missed you.

404
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,701
Gentlemen, my wife.

405
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,619
-Hi.
-How do you do?

406
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,414
I think we will all
remember this day and, uh,

407
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,834
as a souvenir I thought we'd
all pose for a little picture.

408
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,295
Sort of record of the
visitors to my island

409
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,880
which I'd like to keep.

410
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,465
Over here, I think would be all right.

411
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,508
You don't mind gentlemen, do you?

412
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,426
No, no.

413
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,678
My dear, I think it would be nice

414
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,972
if you pose shaking hands with Mr. Smith.

415
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,224
Lorraine, please.

416
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,144
All ready, Doctor?

417
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,437
All ready, Mr. Danel.

418
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,232
Now, let's all have a
nice happy smile, huh?

419
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,944
(camera clicks)

420
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,654
(chuckles) I think I moved.

421
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,406
(men chuckling)
Thank you, gentlemen.

422
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,825
Let's all be seated over there, Mr. Borgo.

423
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,036
Sit right down please, over there.

424
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,873
Mm.

425
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,249
Siggy, I want to compliment you

426
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,126
on this charming arrangement.

427
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,172
Have you lived here long, Mrs. Danel?

428
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,214
Three years.

429
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,884
[Mark] You visit the
mainland sometimes, don't you?

430
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,595
I, I never leave the island.

431
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,764
Oh, I should think you'd
enjoy going on these trips

432
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,223
with Mr. Danel.

433
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,100
Lorraine, your guests are waiting.

434
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,938
(birds chirping)

435
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,483
Thank you, Mr. Smith.

436
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,945
You're very fortunate man, Mr. Danel.

437
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,490
I think so, Mr. Smith.

438
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,660
This reminds me of old times before my.

439
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,371
Before my trouble.

440
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,248
You can forget all about
your troubles here, Mr. Ames.

441
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,838
I don't imagine you
greatly enjoy sitting

442
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,174
at a table with convicts,
do you, Mrs. Danel?

443
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,010
You like your lunch, Mr. Smith?

444
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:31,970
Very much.

445
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,682
(gunshot bangs)

446
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,519
(footsteps tapping)

447
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,895
(utensil clatters)

448
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,148
(footsteps tapping)

449
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,778
Eat fast, it's the last
square meal you'll get.

450
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,530
(footsteps tapping)

451
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,366
You dirty, slave trading rat.

452
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,452
(gunshots banging)

453
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,832
(platters clattering)

454
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:02,959
[Stephen] How did he get in here?

455
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,419
Made a break and slugged the guard.

456
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Danel.

457
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,463
[Stephen] Take him away and hurry up.

458
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,464
Help them, Doctor.

459
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,801
Brand, watch these men.

460
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,302
But why they do shoot him?

461
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:15,680
They'll shoot you too

462
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,099
if you don't do exactly
what you're told to.

463
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,726
-But, Mr. Danel.
-Get away from me.

464
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,436
Put your hands up, all of you.

465
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,854
Step over here.

466
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,397
[Brand] Come on, get going.

467
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,820
Let go of my wife, Mr. Smith.

468
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,781
You heard Mr. Danel, put your hands up.

469
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,741
Move.

470
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,291
Go into the house, Lorraine.

471
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,671
Captain.

472
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,426
I'm sorry, gentlemen,

473
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,845
you didn't have time to finish your meal.

474
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,264
But you'll have to go
with Captain Cort now.

475
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,142
And remember, you'll be shot

476
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,644
if you ever dare to come
near this place again.

477
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,859
Take them away, Captain.

478
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,069
[Cort] Come on, move.

479
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,365
(footsteps crunching)

480
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,243
(dramatic music)

481
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,500
(footsteps crunching)

482
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,923
(footsteps tapping)

483
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,344
Clean up that mess.

484
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,846
Yes sir, yes sir.

485
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,684
Was Mitchell, Doctor, wasn't it?

486
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,312
Dead?

487
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,230
Not yet.

488
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,732
Don't forget to have some extra prints

489
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,734
of the picture we just took.

490
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:56,405
Promised I'd send one of our
friend Mr. Smith to the Warden.

491
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,241
What do you plan to do about him?

492
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,036
What do I plan to do about him?

493
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,415
I've many plans for Mr. Smith.

494
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,962
(dramatic music)

495
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,798
(door clicks)

496
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,054
(door thuds)

497
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,979
I've been away for a long time.

498
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,940
You should be very glad to see me.

499
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,986
I hate the sight of you.

500
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,696
I know that.

501
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,908
Lorraine, you've been in Mr. Smith's arms.

502
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,202
Nothing like that must ever happen again.

503
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,246
It embarrasses me.

504
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,625
You are my wife and he's a murderer.

505
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,169
And what are you?

506
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,504
I'm your husband.

507
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,343
Lorraine, remember this stone?

508
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,431
You can't bribe me with that.

509
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,850
Why should I bribe you?

510
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,103
You've tried everything else and failed.

511
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,314
No matter what you do, you'll always fail.

512
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,983
I've never failed and I will never fail.

513
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,403
I won't wear that, you can't make me.

514
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,447
Of course, you will.

515
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,450
(dramatic music)

516
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,664
So Mr. Smith approves of my taste, eh?

517
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,918
There's only one thing that
Mr. Smith doesn't know.

518
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,296
What I own I keep, but he'll learn.

519
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,506
So will you.

520
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,474
(door clicks and thuds)

521
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,020
Take off your irons.

522
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,523
Hurry up, hurry up, in front of your beds.

523
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,776
(footsteps tapping)

524
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,237
Come on, move along, move along.

525
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,949
(footsteps tapping)

526
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,784
(man groans)

527
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,119
Why don't you get the doctor
for him, if he is a doctor.

528
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,287
What's that to you?

529
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,581
Nothing, only he's dying.

530
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,667
You don't wanna lose any
good hard workers, do you?

531
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,877
Come on, quit faking.

532
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,379
I'm not faking.

533
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,838
Maybe need a taste of this.

534
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,590
Well, if he ain't better in the morning,

535
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,800
he's gonna get it.

536
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,262
And you'll wanna stop talking
so much, now get to your bed.

537
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,183
Lie down.

538
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,478
(footsteps tapping)

539
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,396
Chains.

540
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,651
(chains clattering)

541
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,491
Captain, Mr. Danel wants to
see Mr. Smith up the house.

542
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,409
Huh?

543
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,955
What is he want with you?

544
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,373
Maybe wants a new captain.

545
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,916
Mr. Danel said to
bring him up right away.

546
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,002
Okay, go on.

547
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,631
I'll be walking right behind
you, so don't start anything.

548
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,590
Why should I?

549
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,925
I like it here.

550
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,514
(gentle piano music)

551
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,100
Go on.

552
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,852
Sure, Captain.

553
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,437
I just wondered who is playing.

554
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,188
You see, I'm quite a music lover.

555
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,609
(footsteps tapping)

556
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,111
[Cort] Hold it.

557
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,280
(knuckles rapping)

558
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,494
Go to your room, Lorraine, please.

559
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,125
I've never had a chance to hear

560
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,960
how you talk to your other prisoners.

561
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,378
You mind if I stay?

562
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,005
It might impress me.

563
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,174
Go to your room.

564
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,180
(door clicks)

565
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,931
(door thuds)

566
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:53,601
(door clicks)

567
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,812
Come in, Captain, Mr. Smith.

568
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,153
(door thuds)

569
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,115
You'll forgive me if I don't
ask you to sit down, Mr. Smith,

570
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,828
but your clothes and my furniture,
I'm sure you understand.

571
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,167
Were you actually stupid
enough, Mr. Smith,

572
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,044
to believe you were fooling me?

573
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,587
I don't know what you mean.

574
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,674
You see, I had an office in a building.

575
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,343
Across the hall a man was killed

576
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,720
and you were convicted of murder.

577
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,806
I know who that man was, Mr. Smith.

578
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,808
So does anybody who
read about the trial.

579
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,142
His name was Jackson.

580
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,769
Jackson wasn't his real name.

581
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,770
Oh, wasn't it?

582
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,358
I want to know how
much that man told you

583
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,485
and who else knows what he told you.

584
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,903
He didn't tell me anything.

585
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,114
Don't lie to me, Mr. Smith.

586
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,200
You saw a man shot today.

587
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,035
I can have you shot too,

588
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,247
and no one will ever know.

589
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,331
I know that.

590
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,291
But I can also let you live

591
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,752
and you may live for a long time.

592
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,003
I know that too.

593
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,631
And, uh, don't you
think you better tell me?

594
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,591
I don't know what you're talking about.

595
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,593
Captain.

596
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,719
Yes, sir.

597
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,555
[Stephen] This man
is a government agent.

598
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,515
You got a great imagination, Mr. Danel.

599
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,558
Shut up.

600
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,684
Thank you, Captain.

601
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,812
Oh, Captain, I think you
know what would happen to you

602
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,356
if outsiders found out about our island.

603
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,901
And, uh, this gentleman seems to believe

604
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,611
we can't make him tell.

605
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,698
Who else besides himself knows about this?

606
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,411
I'm afraid you'll have to
use your ingenuity, Captain.

607
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,037
And, of course, uh,

608
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,207
we don't want him to die until
he is told us what he knows.

609
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,460
Take him out, Captain.

610
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,921
We have plenty of time, Mr. Smith,

611
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,716
all the time in the world.

612
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,265
(door clicks)

613
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,477
(door thuds)

614
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,489
(footsteps tapping)
(Mark panting)

615
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,366
Get on there.

616
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,410
Lock him.

617
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,415
(chains clattering)

618
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,556
(scoffs) Maybe you'd better
call out the US Marines,

619
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,808
come on, let's get some sleep.

620
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,271
(Mark panting)

621
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,402
(chains clattering)

622
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,285
You're wasting your time.

623
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,789
(Mark panting)

624
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,959
There's only one way out of here.

625
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,463
Make them kill you.

626
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,510
Don't die day at a time.

627
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,056
Get it over...

628
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,685
then you can rest.

629
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,897
Dead men can't work.

630
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:34,405
Never get out until you die.

631
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:42,079
Then you get parole to a pine box.

632
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,709
(Mitchell coughs)

633
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:02,266
(hammers thudding)
(cart wheels clattering)

634
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,271
(hammers thudding)

635
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,775
Here, let me take it, Eddie.

636
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,572
(hammers thudding)

637
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,741
How long have you been here?

638
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:19,700
Three years.

639
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,994
[Mark] You must know
a lot about the island.

640
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,078
I ought to.

641
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,748
Anybody ever try to get away?

642
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,207
Sure.

643
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,336
Lots of them, nobody ever made it though.

644
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,879
It's 480 miles to the nearest island

645
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,714
and sharks are all around the island.

646
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,090
Some guys have tried to build a raft

647
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,635
or a boat but they always get caught.

648
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,887
Maybe they went at the wrong way.

649
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,804
What you mean?

650
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,599
Well, there's plenty to know.

651
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,850
There's a couple of guards.

652
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,352
If you boys had worked together

653
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,145
maybe something might happen.

654
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,563
Take the island away from them.

655
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,565
What will we use, our hands?

656
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,362
What do you two guys talking about?

657
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,279
Not a thing.

658
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,867
(stones thudding)

659
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,412
(door clicks)

660
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,624
(monkey chitters)

661
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,420
Siggy, would you do something for me?

662
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,339
Yes, ma'am, if I can.

663
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,091
You can get out of
here sometimes, I can't.

664
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,927
You know the new man who
just came, John Smith?

665
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,261
I got to talk to him.

666
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,138
Oh, but you're not
allowed to talk to the men.

667
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,765
I got to talk to him.

668
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,893
Siggy, you wanna get off
this island, don't you?

669
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,354
-Don't you?
-Oh, sure, sure, I do, but.

670
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,315
Well, I'll do the best I can.

671
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,442
I'll be down there when
they are feeding the men,

672
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,027
and maybe I'll get a
chance to talk to him.

673
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,904
Try, will you?
(door clicks)

674
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,242
(monkey chittering)

675
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,412
I've asked you not to come
in the kitchen, Lorraine.

676
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,663
I just wanted to make sure

677
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,832
everything was perfect for dinner.

678
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,251
I know how anything imperfect upsets you.

679
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,754
It's very thoughtful of you, thank you.

680
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,174
(monkey chittering)

681
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,011
(fire hissing)

682
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,848
What did Mrs. Danel really want, Siggy?

683
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,641
Oh, just what she said, Mr. Danel.

684
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,894
(monkey chittering)

685
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,187
I've told you I don't want the monkey

686
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,313
in the house, didn't I?

687
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,648
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

688
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,151
Come on.

689
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,195
Step up, step up.

690
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,990
(plates clattering)

691
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,910
Come on, step into it, step into it.

692
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,662
Second line move in.

693
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,000
Come on, move in, move in.

694
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,377
Hurry up, back there, hurry up.

695
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,755
I can't eat this stuff, the
smell of it makes me sick.

696
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,089
It's better nothing, I guess.

697
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,507
Come on, move on, move on.

698
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,551
What you standing there for?

699
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,225
(insects chirping)

700
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,981
Come on, move up, step up, step up.

701
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,201
I got to talk to you.

702
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,118
What about?

703
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,788
Mrs. Danel wants to see you.

704
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,039
What?

705
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,000
Now look, I got to talk fast, so listen.

706
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,085
She doesn't like it here
any more than we do.

707
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,796
And she wants to get out too.

708
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,298
She thinks maybe you can help
her, I told her you couldn't.

709
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,883
Danel sent you, didn't he?

710
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,842
Oh, no, no.

711
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:24,885
If he even knew I was talking to you,

712
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,261
they'd tie me to the post.

713
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,972
She's awful anxious to see you.

714
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,391
That's all I know and I
got to get out of here.

715
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,647
(insects chirping)

716
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,988
(monkey chittering)

717
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,991
(knuckles rapping)

718
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,119
(door clicks)

719
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,705
I did like you told me to.

720
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,123
What did he say?

721
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,625
Nothing.

722
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,794
Well, I'd better get out of here.

723
00:38:58,878 --> 00:38:59,711
If Mr. Danel knew I was
talking to you like this,

724
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,797
I don't know what he'd do.

725
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,799
I did the best I could, honest I did.

726
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,927
Good night.

727
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,388
(monkey chittering)

728
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,890
Didn't I tell you about that monkey?

729
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,600
I'll teach you.

730
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,476
(monkey chittering)
-Don't.

731
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,727
(gunshot bangs)

732
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,106
Throw that thing out.

733
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,066
Didn't you hear me?

734
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:28,615
You're so brave, against
things that can't fight back.

735
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,826
Don't.

736
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,161
Don't make me do anything else, Lorraine.

737
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,664
Please don't.

738
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,427
Oh, yes, I.

739
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,847
Have a little business with Mr. Smith.

740
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,266
I'll be back.

741
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,193
(insects chirping)

742
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,406
Don't overdo it, Captain.

743
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,203
There's a lot Mr. Smith
ought to tell me and, uh,

744
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,623
and may want to tell
me before you finished.

745
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,918
Oh, and be sure that he's
able to work tomorrow.

746
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,378
Goodnight, Mr. Smith.

747
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,723
(whip cracking)

748
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,483
Okay, you can beat me to death, so what?

749
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,027
Danel gets another man to take my place.

750
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,279
You two, if your foot slips,

751
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,323
he gets another man to take your place.

752
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,159
And what do you get for it?

753
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,079
Danel sits up on his hill
with his safe full of diamonds

754
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,914
and you do all his dirty work.

755
00:40:58,998 --> 00:40:59,957
(whip cracks)

756
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,583
Just a big, dumb ox.

757
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,252
You do all the work and
Danel gets all the gravy.

758
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,337
(whip cracks)
(Mark groans)

759
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,255
Why don't you get smart?

760
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
You silly ape.

761
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,468
(door thuds)

762
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,763
(footsteps tapping)

763
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,264
(bed creaks)

764
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,724
(Brand exhales)

765
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,519
Come on, wake up, come on.

766
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,937
(man groans)

767
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,358
-[Doctor] What's the matter?
-Got a patient for you.

768
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,402
And take good care of him, Doc.

769
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,195
You know, he's Danel's pet prisoner.

770
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,571
Hate to lose him.

771
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,366
[Doctor] You're not going
to leave me alone with him.

772
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,785
What's the matter with the gun?

773
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,287
Come on, let's go.

774
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,460
(Doctor sighs)

775
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:54,428
(footsteps tapping)

776
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,315
(glasses clattering)

777
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,738
(Mark panting)

778
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,207
(Mark breathing heavily)

779
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,353
(Doctor groaning)

780
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,357
(both grunting)

781
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,820
(body thuds)

782
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,073
(both grunting)

783
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,575
(fist thuds)

784
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,703
(Mark panting)

785
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,382
(footsteps tapping)

786
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,677
(dramatic music)

787
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,104
Lorraine?

788
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,041
(dramatic music continues)

789
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,585
(door thuds)

790
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,062
Crying, Lorraine?

791
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,234
Many men are whipped on this island,

792
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,735
you've never cried before.

793
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,573
Mr. Smith...

794
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,201
you've only seen him once.

795
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:26,872
He's tall and dark,

796
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:30,584
and quite attractive, I suppose.

797
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,213
Why speak about it?

798
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,757
It so unimportant.

799
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,180
(dramatic music)

800
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,771
(door clicks)

801
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,403
(birds chirping)
(footsteps tapping)

802
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,989
(leaves rustling)

803
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,574
Captain.

804
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:03,575
What's the matter, Captain?

805
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,243
The man is on the island,
can't you find him?

806
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,579
We've been looking for
him all night, Mr. Danel.

807
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,207
And you'll keep looking for
him every day and every night

808
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,791
until you do find him.

809
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:13,460
Or I'll get a captain who can.

810
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,462
Come on.

811
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,382
(footsteps tapping)

812
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,929
(footsteps tapping)

813
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,765
(birds chirping)

814
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,810
(leaves rustling)

815
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,739
(stone thuds)

816
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,122
(stone clatters)

817
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,125
(birds chirping)

818
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,929
-Don't touch those wires.
-I know.

819
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,514
You said Mrs. Danel wanted see me.

820
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,890
Tell her I'm here, if
she's got anything to say,

821
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,101
she can come out.
Tell her I won't be here long.

822
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,102
[Siggy] They'll get you,

823
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,311
you better get away from here, quick.

824
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,814
Maybe, go on now, go on.

825
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,650
(birds chirping)

826
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,237
(footsteps tapping)

827
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,074
(leaves rustling)

828
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,413
Hey, look.

829
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,837
You follow his trail,
I'll be back at the house.

830
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,923
(footsteps tapping)

831
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:42,841
Over there.

832
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,219
(footsteps tapping)

833
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:51,474
Talk fast, Mrs. Danel,

834
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,226
you said you wanted to see me, why?

835
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,894
Are you really working
for the government?

836
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,396
What difference does that make?

837
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,356
I'm as much a prisoner here as you are,

838
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,358
as any of the men down there.

839
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,152
Oh, I was a fool, I.

840
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,195
I wanted a good home and security.

841
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,989
That's why I married Stephen Danel.

842
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,615
I've been a prisoner ever since

843
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,077
and I'll be a prisoner
until he kills me or I die.

844
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,413
Can you help me get away?

845
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,665
Can I help you whatever
you're trying to do?

846
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,209
Has he got a radio sending set?

847
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,337
-[Lorraine] No.
-Any guns in the house?

848
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,174
Yes, in a locked room,
I've never been in it.

849
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,260
[Mark] You're taking a big
chance being with me now.

850
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,428
Will you take a bigger one?

851
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,846
I'll do anything.

852
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,306
We got to get guns.

853
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,350
I'll pick men I can trust
among the prisoners,

854
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,225
wait for our break,

855
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,227
open up on the guards
and take over the island.

856
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,562
It's the only way.

857
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,230
Can you get your husband's keys?

858
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,358
I don't know.

859
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,525
[Mark] Would you try?

860
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,277
Yes.

861
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,363
(footsteps tapping)

862
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:49,991
I'm going back now.

863
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,576
I can't swing this alone.

864
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,371
We got to take our time
but you take your time too.

865
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,955
We've got to have those keys.

866
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:57,540
(footsteps tapping)

867
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,668
Psst, psst, psst.

868
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,171
Go back in the house now, hurry.

869
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:09,177
(footsteps tapping)

870
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,098
(door thuds)

871
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,018
(footsteps tapping)

872
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,687
(door clicks)

873
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,232
(door thuds)

874
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,608
Lorraine.

875
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:25,860
Where are you, Lorraine?

876
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:27,821
(door thuds)
-Here I am.

877
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,240
What is it?

878
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,619
You look breathless and upset.

879
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:36,371
I wonder why.

880
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,959
I'm just happy, because
my husband is home.

881
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,711
I don't like you when
you talk like that.

882
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,672
I'm so sorry.

883
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,592
Of course, you know that
Mr. Smith is at liberty.

884
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:52,637
Mr. Smith?

885
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,015
Yes I, I remember.

886
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,600
Where were you right now, Lorraine?

887
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,686
-Why, in my room.
-Alone?

888
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,480
Of course.

889
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:13,575
(footsteps tapping)
(leaves rustling)

890
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:25,003
(footsteps tapping)
(leaves rustling)

891
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,383
(leaves rustling)

892
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,552
Listen, you, stand
still, I got you covered.

893
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,762
You got a strong trigger
finger but a weak mind.

894
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:35,680
Listen you.

895
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,515
One minute isn't
gonna cost you anything.

896
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,726
Now, you do some listening
and some thinking.

897
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,936
Your boss wants to know who I am.

898
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,313
Well, I'm a smart guy.

899
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,356
I killed a guy that was after Danel, sure.

900
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,317
But I found out what he knew first.

901
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,776
I found out where there
was a stack of diamonds

902
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,987
just waiting for someone
to come along and get them.

903
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,697
He thinks I'm a government man.

904
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,283
Well, I'm not, I'm on my own.

905
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,409
I had a tough time getting here

906
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,870
and it's gonna be a whole
lot tougher getting out.

907
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,372
So if I can get off this
island and back to the States,

908
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:02,665
I got connections.

909
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,334
I can sell Danel's stuff for more cash

910
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,377
than you'd see if you
live a million years.

911
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,087
Unless you get smart.

912
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,340
-What do you think you're doing?
-If you work with me,

913
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,051
we can make the biggest
cleanup that ever happened.

914
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,053
Or you can take me back,

915
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:18,139
whip the life out of me,
and tell Danel what a fine boy you are.

916
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,059
And sooner or later you'll be dead.

917
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,646
Well, if you're such a big
shot, what do you want with me?

918
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,397
I want a partner,

919
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,775
a chance to move around
and figure the angles.

920
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,444
You're a swell target.

921
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,156
I didn't have to talk to you, you know.

922
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,157
Go on, take it.

923
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,329
But if there's any brain in
that thick head of yours,

924
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,247
use it.

925
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,209
Come on, start walking.

926
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,922
(leaves rustling)

927
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,926
You claim you got big ideas.

928
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,719
Tell them to me and make it fast.

929
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:00,515
-And you wanna make a deal?
-Now, I don't know what you got to sell.

930
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,516
Well, if we're gonna
take over the island,

931
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,142
we've got to get rid of Danel.

932
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,395
We got to be able to get
at the guns he's got in the house

933
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,813
and the plane he's got
locked up in the hanger,

934
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,773
and the stuff you want from the house.

935
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,191
How can you do that?

936
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,734
I've got an angle.

937
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:12,735
Yeah?

938
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,778
What angle?

939
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:14,946
Mrs. Danel.

940
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,073
What do you mean?

941
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,742
Mrs. Danel is trying
to get his keys for me.

942
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,369
That's all we need.

943
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,122
But why should she'd be working for you?

944
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,206
What do you think?

945
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,376
She's waiting for me out there now.

946
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,004
Look, Cort,

947
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,590
you didn't bring me back
here to put me in solitary,

948
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,426
you did it because you
wanna throw in with me.

949
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,343
All right.

950
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,597
If you wanna gamble, play the whole hand.

951
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,473
Fix it so that I can
get out of here tonight

952
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,891
and roam around.

953
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,893
Then let me get out of here
a couple of hours every night

954
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,478
until I can get to Mrs. Danel.

955
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,022
Then what?

956
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,858
Then, when we're all set, we take over.

957
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,276
You and me.

958
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,861
Oh, what if Danel gets wise?

959
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:56,821
You're in the clear.

960
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,700
What could you do with a million dollars?

961
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:02,952
How about it?

962
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,332
Put your hands up there, go on.

963
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,170
I ain't gonna lock them.

964
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,048
I'm gonna take a chance once.

965
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,300
But if you double cross me.
-Why should I?

966
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,552
I'll be here at four in the morning

967
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,471
to get you off to work.

968
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,764
And you better be here.

969
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,265
I'll be here.

970
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,726
(door clatters)

971
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,810
All set?

972
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,228
Yeah, all set.

973
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,943
(door clicks)

974
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,864
(cuffs clatter)

975
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:43,534
(dramatic music)

976
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,998
(door clicks)

977
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,378
(leaves rustling)

978
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,553
(intense music)

979
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,876
(intense music continues)

980
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,906
(intense music continues)

981
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,811
(intense music continues)

982
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,607
(footsteps crunching)

983
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,157
(lock clicks)

984
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,415
(leaves rustling)

985
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,542
Let's get away from here.

986
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,213
(leaves rustling)

987
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,800
(intense music continues)

988
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:06,427
Here.

989
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,513
How did you do it?

990
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,640
I, I just took them.

991
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,183
What we going to do?

992
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,227
It's about a half a dozen
men I can trust down there.

993
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,521
I'll get them loose, then
try to get guns for them.

994
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:20,107
Cort thinks I'm working with
him, had to do a lot of lying.

995
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,026
You will take me with you, won't you?

996
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,904
Let go of my wife, Mr. Smith.

997
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,657
(intense music)

998
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:35,248
(leaves rustling)

999
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,415
Let go of my wife.

1000
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,337
Give me the keys.

1001
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,466
(keys jingle)

1002
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,388
Lorraine, you should've remembered
I'm a very light sleeper.

1003
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:57,687
Go home now, Lorraine.
(intense music continues)

1004
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,400
For the sake of my wife

1005
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,152
don't force me to have you
killed in front of her.

1006
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,325
Go home, Lorraine.

1007
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,248
(leaves rustling)

1008
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,501
I'll give you orders
about him in the morning.

1009
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:24,672
(intense music continues)

1010
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,591
Captain, give me your gun.

1011
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,928
You're a very clever man, Mr. Smith

1012
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,724
but unfortunately, Cort
wasn't clever enough.

1013
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,603
He didn't realise that
Brand had a suspicion

1014
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,979
and told me everything.

1015
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,482
You take charge from
now on, Captain Brand.

1016
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,955
(intense music continues)

1017
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,167
All right, get going.

1018
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,299
(intense music)

1019
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:15,389
(gate clatters)

1020
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,157
You better lock me up
with the other prisoners

1021
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,742
or you better kill me,

1022
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,910
because there's nothing in the world

1023
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,995
you can do to make me stop hating you.

1024
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,831
(dramatic music)

1025
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,687
(door thuds)

1026
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:11,862
(footsteps tapping)

1027
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,699
(dramatic music)

1028
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,085
Come on, pick up your irons.

1029
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,169
(footsteps tapping)

1030
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,587
Make it snappy, move.

1031
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,214
In front of your beds.

1032
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,050
Come on, keep going.

1033
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:38,931
(metals clattering)
(footsteps tapping)

1034
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,436
How do you like finding out

1035
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,229
how the other half lives, Cort?

1036
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,480
Stand back.

1037
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:49,817
Lie down.

1038
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:51,944
Chains.

1039
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,240
(chains clattering)

1040
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,075
You sure look good there, Cort.

1041
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,372
(chains clattering)

1042
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:06,959
Hurry up.

1043
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:10,129
(prisoners shouting)

1044
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,967
(chain thuds)

1045
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,970
(prisoners shouting)

1046
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,934
All right, now we're getting out.

1047
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:25,936
But the first thing we
got to do is get Danel,

1048
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,772
he's got guns up at the house.

1049
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,106
You're gonna follow me,

1050
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,650
do what you're told and
play the game my way.

1051
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,944
If this works, we all get out of here.

1052
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:35,780
(footsteps tapping)
Hold it.

1053
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:39,450
Oh, you're a great talker
and you got a great line.

1054
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:45,039
But I don't like you and
I'm running things now.

1055
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,709
You know, I've been talking
to a few of the boys myself.

1056
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,045
And you know what you
gonna do, Mr. Smart Guy?

1057
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,296
You're gonna talk to Mrs. Danel

1058
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,423
and you gonna get us in
that house if you can.

1059
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:58,010
And if you can't, I'm
gonna blow you apart.

1060
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,304
Borgo, Durkin, you know
what I promised you

1061
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,347
if you'd go along.

1062
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,308
Now then the first thing we
got to do is to get Danel.

1063
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,103
You keep your hands off that woman,

1064
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:09,563
I'll take care of her myself.

1065
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,148
Now come on, get going.

1066
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:12,817
Come on, hurry up.

1067
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,820
(insects chirping)

1068
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,700
No possible way to
get through that fence.

1069
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,203
-You're wrong, Doctor.
-What you mean?

1070
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,038
I'm gonna play ball with you, Cort.

1071
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,081
I think I can get through.

1072
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,749
Are you crazy?
It's sure death.

1073
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:29,917
And if you do, then what?

1074
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,585
After I get through, I get Danel.

1075
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,212
Then I'll open the gate.

1076
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,923
You can relax, you got nothing to lose.

1077
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,843
(leaves rustling)

1078
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,099
(dramatic music)

1079
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,247
(electricity crackling)

1080
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:16,172
(dramatic music continues)

1081
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,181
Would you like to try it first, Captain?

1082
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,098
Go on.

1083
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,076
(dramatic music continues)

1084
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,833
-I'll see you in a minute.
-Don't try to pull anything.

1085
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,460
Don't worry, you're the boss.

1086
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,379
He'll never get into the house.

1087
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:01,800
(dramatic music continues)

1088
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,937
(door clicks)

1089
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,483
(floor creaks)

1090
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,571
(door clicks)

1091
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,782
(intense music)
Good evening, Mr. Smith.

1092
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,453
I was waiting for you,

1093
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,705
I was hoping you would come soon.

1094
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,250
Cort is out there,
Cort and a couple of men.

1095
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:35,918
They're armed and they're coming in.

1096
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,629
But you didn't come to see
me, you came to see my wife.

1097
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,173
Come, Mr. Smith, I'll get her for you.

1098
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:45,010
(footsteps tapping)

1099
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,136
Wait.

1100
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:48,639
Lorraine?

1101
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,141
Lorraine.

1102
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,854
Forgive me, Mr. Smith,
she'll be here in a moment.

1103
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,775
(intense music)

1104
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,334
[Cort] Come on.

1105
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:31,223
(intense music continues)

1106
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,147
You must stand very
close to him, very close.

1107
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,358
Yes, Lorraine.

1108
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,278
Smile.

1109
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,992
(footsteps tapping)

1110
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:55,831
He likes you when you smile, Lorraine.

1111
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,876
Listen to me, that gang
is coming in after her.

1112
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,880
When I find a flaw in a
diamond, I throw it away.

1113
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,177
(intense music)

1114
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,940
It's so hard to remember,
it's a long time ago.

1115
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,361
Everything on this island belonged to me.

1116
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:28,614
Everything.

1117
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,743
And it was beautiful.

1118
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,454
My wife, beautiful,

1119
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,456
(intense music continues)

1120
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:38,749
So beautiful.

1121
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,755
And then, you came...

1122
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,009
and you touched my wife.

1123
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:52,888
(footsteps tapping)

1124
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,390
(door thuds)

1125
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,809
(gunshot bangs)

1126
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:57,935
Drop that gun.

1127
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:58,852
(gun thuds)

1128
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,772
Come in gentlemen, come in.

1129
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,565
Want you to meet my wife.

1130
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,818
Don't touch her.

1131
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,530
(intense music continues)

1132
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,448
You'll forget him, Lorraine.

1133
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,536
You'll forget everything after a while.

1134
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,501
I want you to meet these
gentlemen, Lorraine.

1135
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,212
They are your friends, you like them.

1136
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,506
I'm going to let you go back with them.

1137
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,050
Want you to be happy...

1138
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,806
but you must say goodbye to Mr. Smith.

1139
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:39,476
(intense music continues)

1140
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,523
I'm not going to kill you, Lorraine.

1141
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,317
I want you to live.

1142
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,988
Live for a long time.

1143
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,865
(knife thuds)
(Stephen groans)

1144
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,118
(Stephen panting)

1145
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,077
(gunshot bangs)

1146
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,829
(Siggy groans)
(body thuds)

1147
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,915
(Stephen panting)

1148
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:06,879
Everything

1149
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,883
on this island belonged to me.

1150
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:17,347
(gun thuds)

1151
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,348
Everything.

1152
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:26,773
Everything belongs to me...

1153
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,611
as long as I live.

1154
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,571
(body thuds)

1155
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,407
(dramatic music)

1156
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:55,719
(plane engine revving)
(gentle music)

1157
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,140
The last of Dead Man's Island.

1158
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:11,068
(instrumental music)
