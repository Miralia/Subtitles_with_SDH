1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,797
(dramatic string music)

2
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:57,014
(seductive saxophone music)

3
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,083
(seductive saxophone music continues)

4
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:52,570
(seductive saxophone music continues)

5
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,594
(truck revs)

6
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,472
- Good morning.

7
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,598
- [All] Good morning.

8
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,974
- Has the director told you anything yet?

9
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,267
- No.
- No.

10
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,393
- I didn't think so.

11
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,479
Well, here's the deal.

12
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,065
We've got just enough cash to
get us through the production.

13
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:29,899
I think.

14
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,611
Uh, the studio's allowing
us to shoot here,

15
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,196
so long as we don't get anyone's way.

16
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:39,033
All we have to do is pay our
electricity bill every week.

17
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,077
- You mean to tell us we don't get paid?

18
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,914
- You'll get to star in
a major motion picture!

19
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,748
Maybe.

20
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,572
(footsteps pattering)

21
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,378
- Farris. ..

22
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,422
I must see their shoulders!

23
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,298
- Shoulders?

24
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,133
- Exactly.

25
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,385
- Well. ..

26
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,143
Pinky Malloy!

27
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,061
Are you primarily an actor or a boxer?

28
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,771
- Uh, basically a boxer.

29
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,605
- That's great.

30
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,233
Because the character
that you would be playing

31
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,193
is the part of a boxer,

32
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,737
who falls in love with a dance hall girl.

33
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,405
Now, the important thing about this boxer

34
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,574
is that he must personify the meanings

35
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:06,579
of the words jealousy, of
passion, of love, of tender.. .

36
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,830
- Forget it.

37
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,749
- Well, I really haven't
done anything before.

38
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,500
I’m just looking to break in.

39
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,919
- I can be a 23-year-old actor.

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,796
Just this.. don't let this face fool you.

41
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,964
I've done some boxing too.

42
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,258
I didn't get it from
selling Good Humor ice cream

43
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,509
on the street corner.

44
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,802
- Sure, I could play Italian.

45
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,387
- [Farris] Are you Italian in any way?

46
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,805
I mean, do you like pasta?

47
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,892
- Oh, I love pasta.

48
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,310
- Yeah, I never lost a fight, man.

49
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,144
Never lost a fight.

50
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,020
- [Farris] Did you ever win a fight?

51
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:31,854
- Yeah, I won a. . .

52
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,606
What do you mean? Of course I won a fight.

53
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,108
- [Stanley] So, you think
you can be an actor?

54
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,611
- I can do just about
anything if I want to.

55
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,321
- [Farris] What kind
of theater? What roles?

56
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,655
- Uh, high school.

57
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,490
- What's going. ..

58
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,365
Hey, what are you doing?

59
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,619
- [Stanley] I'm consulting
with my producer.

60
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,996
- Well, if I'm gonna be a part
of this movie, what the hell?

61
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,247
Why don't you talk to me too?

62
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,207
- Thank you very much.

63
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,000
- He's an actor and he's a boxer.

64
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,126
- Farris, get him the fuck outta here

65
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,377
or I'll break your neck.

66
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,212
(Farris laughs)

67
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,046
- My name's Tony.

68
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,798
Look, let me help you guys out, all right?

69
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,674
Listen, I know you've
been sittin' here all day,

70
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,968
you've been looking at all
these other rummies around here.

71
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,844
You want me to help you?

72
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,848
Look, I'm a professional actor,
and I'm also a good fighter.

73
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,850
- Yeah, I have worked
in a couple of movies.

74
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,685
No big named people, mostly college stuff.

75
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,687
You know, they like
people that look like me.

76
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,273
- Farris, why is he
wearing a goddamn shirt?

77
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,611
- Stanley, for God's sake,
this is Esteban Molinas.

78
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,821
- I've seen you fight.

79
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,823
You were good.

80
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,866
- For a couple of years,
I was really good.

81
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,784
14 and 1 .

82
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,453
But it wasn't in my heart.

83
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,871
I did it for the money.

84
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,331
- There's no money in this.

85
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,209
- You know, I grew up in the streets.

86
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,711
I learned to fight 'cause
I had to defend myself.

87
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,421
Once you live like that,

88
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,632
you have to live inside yourself.

89
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,926
You have to have so much control.

90
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,972
In acting, you can be anything you want,

91
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,057
you can feel anything you want,

92
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,475
you could express yourself.

93
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,478
Yeah. Acting makes me happy.

94
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,069
- Are you available tomorrow?

95
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,655
- Tomorrow? Uh.. what's tomorrow?

96
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,531
- [Farris] Thursday.

97
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,032
- Come back.

98
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,909
I think I may have something for you.

99
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,958
- Stevie Blake.

100
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,169
- Do you have an appointment?

101
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,337
- Give me a break, huh?

102
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,506
- Mhm.

103
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,592
- What have you done?

104
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,968
- What have I done?

105
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,219
What have I done? Are you kidding me?

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,346
Don't you know who I am?

107
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,806
- No.

108
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,766
- Well, it's who you can be that counts.

109
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,060
And I can be anything you want.

110
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,895
Anything.

111
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,064
- Ask him if he can be a boxer.

112
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,859
- Could YOU be a boxer?

113
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,360
- I could've been a contender.

114
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,196
I could've been a contender.

115
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,656
- This guy doesn't look like a boxer.

116
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,117
He doesn't even look like an actor.

117
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,660
- Precisely, Farris.

118
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,246
Ask him where he's from.

119
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,832
- Where are you from?

120
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,083
- New York.

121
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,127
Where do you think, Paris?

122
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:00,961
Farris?

123
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,714
- Ask him what he thinks of blondes.

124
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,134
- What do you?

125
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,469
- You know what they say. ..

126
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,347
- No.

127
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,391
- If you've got one life to
live, live it with a blonde.

128
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,225
- Nooo!

129
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,186
It's "If you've got one
life to live, live it-"

130
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,854
- Is she on the set?

131
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,399
- Should be.

132
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,279
(mellow seductive jazzy music)

133
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:49,510
(mellow seductive jazzy music continues)

134
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,480
- Carol Redding, Steven Blake.

135
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,944
Carol is playing Betty.

136
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,947
(soft string music)

137
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,997
- [Stevie] Hi, gorgeous.

138
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,208
- He's been watching her through
the window for two years.

139
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,043
He's been watching her dress,

140
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,129
he's been watching her undress.

141
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,381
He knows her apartment
like he knows his own.

142
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,717
He even knows where she puts her lipstick.

143
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,177
But he's never spoken to her.

144
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,972
One night, he's lying in bed.

145
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,891
He's tossing, he's
turning, he can't sleep.

146
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,561
Suddenly, from across the courtyard. ..

147
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,397
(Stanley screams)

148
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:49,570
Who is it?

149
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,364
It's the girl from across the courtyard.

150
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,408
- The one he's been
watching for two years.

151
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,284
Carol's role.

152
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,452
- Cut to the young boxer.

153
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,371
He looks across, there's a man in a room.

154
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,667
He runs to the door, down
the hall, the man hides.

155
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,877
- Ms. Stein?

156
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,919
- [Stein] Yes, Mr. Silva?

157
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,962
- [Frank] You get it?

158
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,796
- [Stein] Yes, Mr. Silva.

159
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,964
- Bring it in.

160
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,511
- He gets to her door. ..

161
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,014
(phone rings)

162
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,308
- Yeah.

163
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,936
If you're nervous, you
shouldn't borrow money.

164
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,273
Forget it.

165
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,107
(phone thuds)

166
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,317
No second chances.

167
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,572
- He gets to her door, the
door behind which lives. ..

168
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,740
Betty.

169
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,616
Carol, right?

170
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,159
He kicks it in!

171
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,578
(door thuds)

172
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,625
The girl is by the window, about to faint.

173
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,919
He catches her as she falls,

174
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,214
and he lays her on a small, iron bed.

175
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,258
He brushes a strand of blonde
hair away from one eye.

176
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,468
She's woken up.

177
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,970
She's looking at him as
if from a long way off.

178
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,097
"What's the matter?"

179
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,516
This will kill you.

180
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:04,269
She looks at him. Trying to focus, huh?

181
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,688
And she says one word to him.

182
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,232
What does she say?

183
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,652
Jealousy.

184
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,486
- Jealousy!

185
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,785
- Okay, fellas. ls that it?

186
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,994
I got work to do here.

187
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,706
- Is that it?

188
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,667
Jesus Christ, it's just the beginning.

189
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,086
They've only just met.

190
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,170
- Do you want a receipt?

191
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,004
- Send it.

192
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,757
We'll do this week by week.

193
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,846
Listen, she's been very depressed.

194
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,514
Make her happy.

195
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,432
That's all I want, you understand?

196
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,184
- Believe me, we'll take care of that.

197
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,187
Big talent, and a nice person too.

198
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,689
Don't you worry about a thing.

199
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,614
(door thuds)
(Frank laughs)

200
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,867
- Do I look like the worrying type?

201
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,160
- We got it, we got it!

202
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,287
- Yeah, week by week, that asshole.

203
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,708
(soft string music)

204
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,003
- [Farris] He changed his mind again.

205
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,921
He said to put a dressing
room on the stage.

206
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,922
- [Stanley] We don't have enough money

207
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,090
for him to change his mind.

208
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,508
- [Farris] You wanna tell him that?

209
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,721
(soft dramatic music)

210
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,155
(soft dramatic music continues)

211
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,370
(people chattering)

212
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,881
(people laughing)

213
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,633
Redding and Blake!

214
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,218
Redding and Blake!

215
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,552
On stage immediately.

216
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,390
(soft dramatic music continues)

217
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,936
(Farris claps)

218
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,062
Okay, everybody.

219
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,815
It's our first day, everybody's nervous,

220
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,817
but we're all professionals.

221
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,860
So.. .

222
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,820
Let's go.

223
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,410
- Last night, you heard her scream,

224
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,454
and you ran over, and you calmed her down.

225
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,083
You took care of her.
She was like a child.

226
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,126
This morning, she's grateful.

227
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,922
She's an adult, meaning cynical.

228
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:37,923
(people laughing)

229
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,801
Farris, can we have
quiet on the set, please?

230
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,677
- Quiet, please!

231
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,095
Quiet on the set.

232
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,307
- Well, and then I came to New York.

233
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,309
I was lonely and...

234
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,686
Well, you know.

235
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,770
- A long pause here.

236
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,652
- I took a job in a dance hall.

237
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,195
I like to dance.

238
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,864
- Play with the glass, on the table.

239
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,327
- And then of course, I met Mr. Scandelli,

240
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,537
who owns the dance hall.

241
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,871
- Is that the guy from last night?

242
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,706
- I-

243
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,209
- You give him a look, and then look away.

244
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,129
- At first, he was so nice.

245
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,046
So kind.

246
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,172
But then he. ..

247
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,674
- Don't overdo it.

248
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,889
- Then he wanted more than
I was willing to give.

249
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,057
- Good, Blake.

250
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,562
- What's your story?

251
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,814
- Well, I kinda don't have one.

252
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,400
I was a boxer, until yesterday.

253
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,360
Now.. .

254
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,904
Now I’m thinkin'...

255
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,866
Maybe I'll go back to Iowa.

256
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,284
- Don't indicate.

257
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,245
- Now I’m thinking, maybe
I’ll go back to Iowa.

258
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,079
- Good.

259
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,416
- D-d-depends.

260
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,834
(Carol laughs)

261
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,002
- Ms. Redding!

262
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,589
- Iowa?

263
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,342
Depends on what?

264
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,763
- Okay.

265
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,056
Let's do it again.

266
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,183
Only this time, let's talk to each other.

267
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,601
All right?

268
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,561
Farris, get the lights set, please.

269
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,230
- Gentlemen, ladies, get moving.

270
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,277
- Well, and then I came to New York.

271
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,862
I was lonely and...

272
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,448
Well, you know.

273
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,827
I took a job in a dance hall.

274
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,828
- Mmh.

275
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,330
- I like to dance.

276
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,834
And then of course, I met Mr. Scandelli,

277
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,795
who owns the dance hall.

278
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,631
- Is that the guy from last night?

279
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,844
- At first he was so nice, so kind.

280
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,013
But then he-

281
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,348
- Lean closer, Blake!

282
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,104
- It's okay.

283
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,647
- Oh, you touched her hand.

284
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,690
That's good.. .

285
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,942
Uh, keep that.

286
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,739
You need to let more happen to you.

287
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,368
- At first, he was so nice, so kind.

288
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,911
But then he. ..

289
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,997
Then he wanted more than
I was willing to give.

290
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,124
What's your story?

291
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,917
(soft sentimental score begins)

292
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,422
- I kinda don't have one.

293
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,923
I was a boxer.

294
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,716
You know, 'til the other day.

295
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,011
Now?

296
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,931
Now I'm thinking. ..

297
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,892
Maybe I'll go back to Iowa.

298
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,021
Depends.

299
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,815
- Iowa?

300
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:42,649
- Yeah.

301
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,860
- Depends on what?

302
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,031
- Okay, let's go for a take.

303
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:56,037
(sensual saxophone music)

304
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,624
- Well, and then I came to New York.

305
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,129
I was lonely and...

306
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,797
Well, you know.

307
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,759
I took a job in a dance hall.

308
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,220
I like to dance.

309
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,057
And then of course, I met Mr. Scandelli,

310
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,684
who owns the dance hall.

311
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,729
- Is that the guy from last night?

312
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,401
- At first he was so nice, so kind.

313
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,527
But then he. ..

314
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,116
Then he wanted more than
I was willing to give.

315
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,952
(soft saxophone music continues)

316
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,454
What's your story?

317
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,126
- I kinda don't have one.

318
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,712
I was a boxer, until yesterday.

319
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,048
Now.. .

320
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,426
I’m thinking of going back to lowa.

321
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,679
Depends.

322
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,514
- Iowa?

323
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,599
Depends on what?

324
00:16:58,935 --> 00:16:59,768
(soft saxophone music continues)

325
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,110
(saxophone music fading)

326
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,613
- Cut!

327
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:13,990
Ms. Redding, you're not the director

328
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,034
of this motion picture, I am.

329
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,119
And your job is to stay in character

330
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,830
until you hear me, and only me, say "Cut".

331
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,375
ls that understood?

332
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,640
- Hey, there you are.

333
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,184
- Yes, here I am.

334
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,103
- Hey, listen.

335
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,814
Could happen to anybody.
It's not a big deal.

336
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,857
- Thanks, but no thanks.

337
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,858
I loused up.

338
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,193
- Well, you know what they say.

339
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,027
- Who?

340
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,615
I'm sorry. What do they say?

341
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,118
- That it's lucky to have a bad first day.

342
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,369
- Do they really say that?

343
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,203
- Sure.

344
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,830
'Cause it can only get better.

345
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,748
Let's go for a walk around
the lot, do something.

346
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,542
It's beautiful out, c'mon.

347
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:09,129
- You're crazy. I'm going
home and get some sleep.

348
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,963
I'm beat.

349
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,803
- Hey.

350
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,264
You were good.

351
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,558
- Was I?

352
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,475
- Better than good.

353
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,688
- Good night.

354
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,946
(soft music)

355
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,031
- [Stanley] Nice girl.

356
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,116
- Could be.

357
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,535
- Don't be too cautious.

358
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,372
Emotionally she's a child,

359
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,708
on the verge of becoming a woman.

360
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,503
- When she does, she's
gonna be a great actress.

361
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:52,881
Great.

362
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,218
(Stanley sighs)

363
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,553
She may need a little help.

364
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,518
(soft music continues)

365
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,983
(car engine revs)

366
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,408
(soft music continues)

367
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,246
- Frank!

368
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,957
I think I was good. I
really think I was good!

369
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,917
- Really?

370
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,210
- Yeah!
- Really?

371
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,044
- Yeah.

372
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,546
- You're very late.

373
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,714
- Oh, what time is it?

374
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,840
- It's nine o'clock.

375
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,759
- Nine o'clock?

376
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,593
- Shoot!

377
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,346
I better get to bed. I
got a six o'clock call.

378
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,015
- In the morning?

379
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,433
- That's show business.

380
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:50,313
(soft music continues)

381
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,653
- Show business.

382
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,822
- I gotta talk to you, Billy.

383
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,365
Do it.

384
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,658
Do it, do what he says.

385
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,909
I gotta talk to you, Billy.

386
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,369
Do it, do it.

387
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,704
Do what he says.

388
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,165
Do it, do it.

389
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,458
Gotta do it.

390
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,292
Do what he says-

391
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,460
- Hey, what are you doin'?

392
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,586
- Learning my lines.

393
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,421
- Oh.

394
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,880
Well then, there's two things you gotta do

395
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,757
before you go to bed each night.

396
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,218
You gotta go through
your lines five times.

397
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,136
By the morning. ..

398
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,178
(Stevie snaps)

399
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,972
You'll know 'em like your own.

400
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,140
- And the second thing?

401
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,393
- You have to think about me.

402
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,227
(Carol chuckles)

403
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,061
Come on, let's go.

404
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:37,861
(people faintly shouting)
(bag thuds)

405
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:47,954
- Okay, come on.

406
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,788
Let's go.

407
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,207
That's it.

408
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,876
There.

409
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,085
Keep your hands up.

410
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,008
(bag thuds)

411
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:04,929
Hey, come on.

412
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,889
Let's go.

413
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,182
Stick the left hand.

414
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,935
(bag thuds)
Good.

415
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,353
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

416
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,941
(glove thuds)

417
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,234
Okay, okay.

418
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,068
Good.

419
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,111
How you feelin'?

420
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,446
- I feel all right.

421
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,655
- Okay.

422
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,782
Just keep the elbows in.

423
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,617
- Yeah. Give it to me.

424
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,160
- Forget it. Don't drop
the left hand, huh?

425
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,412
- I won't drop the left hand. It'll be up.

426
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,956
- Okay, now remember, this
guy's got a glass jaw.

427
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,750
One pop on the chin, and
we go home early, huh?

428
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,001
- I'm gonna uppercut him to death.

429
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:35,835
Don't worry.

430
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,669
- Yeah.

431
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,922
- I gotta talk to you, Billy. I gotta.

432
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:39,923
Do it, do it.

433
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,258
You gotta do it. Do what he says.

434
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,385
- I know why he wants
me to throw the fight.

435
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,345
It's 'cause of you.

436
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,098
But you're more important
to me than he is.

437
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,518
- Cut.

438
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,646
Farris, didn't it ever occur to you

439
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,564
that the manager wouldn't be here?

440
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,360
- I didn't write the script,
you wanted him there.

441
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,445
- Esteban.

442
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,279
Ven aqui.

443
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,621
We'll take it from where
you enter, Ms. Redding.

444
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,206
Blake, you're alone now.

445
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,791
It's five minutes to fight time.

446
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,210
First positions!

447
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,384
- Roll sound.

448
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,885
- We have speed.

449
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,178
- Roll camera.

450
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,012
- Rolling.

451
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,515
Scene 8, take 2.

452
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,724
Marker.

453
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:36,729
(marker claps)
(water splashes)

454
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:40,900
- How is it?

455
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,779
- A little chilly.

456
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,447
- No, the movie. How's the movie?

457
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,742
- You get there in the morning,

458
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,453
and next thing you know,
it's time to go home.

459
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,289
So exciting.

460
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,667
And you do a scene good,
and everything seems right.

461
00:22:58,878 --> 00:22:59,961
(Frank chuckles)

462
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,380
- And the director, how's he doing?

463
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,757
- Well, we have to work on Saturday.

464
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,758
We're a day behind.

465
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,302
But he's clever, I think.

466
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,887
- He better be clever.

467
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,346
I gave him a lot of my money.

468
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,724
- I do know.

469
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,020
And I do appreciate it.

470
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:18,855
- And the kid.

471
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,232
What about the kid?

472
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,985
- What about him?

473
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,613
(soft string music)

474
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,156
(Carol groans)

475
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:28,990
Frank!

476
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:31,868
Let go.

477
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,664
(soft string music continues)

478
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,166
- [Frank] Get out.

479
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:49,928
(soft string music continues)
(water splashes)

480
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,681
- I just hate to leave this place.

481
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,352
Every night, it's like saying
goodnight to a sweetheart.

482
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,691
- Yeah.

483
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,525
Hey.

484
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,360
- It's only me.

485
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,111
- [Guard] I want you to
meet a friend of mine.

486
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,324
- Hi. How's the coffee biz?

487
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,158
- Okay.

488
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,703
- Oh, I gotta go.

489
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,663
See ya later, man.

490
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:17,497
Goodnight, Shirley.

491
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,375
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, kid.

492
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,209
Nice boy.

493
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,169
Actor.

494
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,216
Mm.
(faint upbeat radio music)

495
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,426
Good guy for you to know.

496
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,220
- I never know what to say.

497
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,056
- You know, Shirley...

498
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,975
People have time for people like you,

499
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,226
if you want them to.

500
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,980
Don't be so. .. so bashful.

501
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:42,814
Don't hide it.

502
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,483
I got nothing to hide.

503
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,903
- Oh, Shirley!

504
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,530

518
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,791
- Everybody's done something
they're ashamed of.

519
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,501
Everybody's got a past.

520
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,335
- I know.

521
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,755
But it's hard for a girl
to get her pride back out.

522
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:52,467
- It's not what you've
done, or what you've been,

523
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,886
it's what you can become, aah, Betty.

524
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,764
Believe in us.

525
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,974
- I do. I do.

526
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,143
- We're back on stage in half an hour.

527
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,854
Half an hour, 30 minutes.

528
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,607
- 1 800 seconds.

529
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,612
- That's exactly 1 800
seconds, Ms. Redding.

530
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,780
And not a second more.

531
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,784
(people laughing)

532
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,168
(footsteps tapping)

533
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,506
- [Stanley] I've got it, Farris.

534
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,257
It's been bothering me all week.

535
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,175
The dance hall owner.

536
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,426
- Something's been bothering me too-

537
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,511
- Wait!

538
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,345
The dance hall owner.

539
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,806
When he asked the boxer
to throw the fight, huh?

540
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:40,848
The symbolic fight,

541
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,767
which he is not going to throw after all,

542
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,935
because he loves the girl.

543
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,604
- Does Blake know where we
got the cash for this film?

544
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,356
Does he know about Carol and Silva?

545
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,983
- Heat.

546
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,984
Heat!

547
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,778
There must be heat between them.

548
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,447
If they're hot, the audience is hot.

549
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,615
If the audience is hot,

550
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,909
finally we make some money, huh?

551
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,120
Please, don't tell tales outta school.

552
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,913
I want an alley for a scene

553
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,666
between the dance hall
owner and the boxer.

554
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,293
And then afterwards, we
can use it for the capture.

555
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,755
- What? I don't understand.

556
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,423
- An alley, a small alley.

557
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,299
It's simple.

558
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,426
- Where is this alley?

559
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,220
- Build one!

560
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,223
- My dear Stanley, alleys are expensive.

561
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,102
- Sit down, Farris.

562
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,691
We're working very hard, huh?

563
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,194
And we finished one week's
filming, and we have more.

564
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,572
Now, I hope that the money is in order.

565
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,739
- I called yesterday,

566
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,909
and he said he'd bring it here
Monday morning first thing.

567
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,743
- Good.

568
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,828
You are doing your job.

569
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,082
Except for one thing.

570
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,751
- What's that?

571
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,671
- Under no circumstances
do I ever eat liverwurst.

572
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,924
(Stanley spits)

573
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,301
- Hi, Big Louie.

574
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,263
(mellow jazzy music)

575
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,522
Hey, Mark.

576
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,356
Hi, Jeff.

577
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,653
You owe me a week's
pay, and I want it now.

578
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,405
- Where are you gonna go?

579
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,239
What are you gonna do?

580
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,365
- I'm going to Iowa.

581
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,618
The air is better up there.

582
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,912
- Betty, you and me.

583
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,496
We had a plan, we-

584
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,332
- You and me? Hah!

585
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,168
You're an old man, your hair is greasy,

586
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,045
you've got a hunchback and you smell.

587
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,548
- Get outta here!

588
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,716
Get outta here, before I. . .

589
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,468
Get outta my sight!

590
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,886
Get out! Get out!

591
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,263
- Nothing would make me
happier, but I ain't go nowhere

592
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,307
till you give me the money you owe me!

593
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,767
- Betty, don't say anything.

594
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:48,809
I'm begging you not.

595
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,811
Please, I always hurt the ones I love.

596
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,855
Please don't let it happen again.

597
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,315
Please!

598
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:58,110
(Scandelli sobs)
(mellow jazzy music continues)

599
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,738
- I'd rather be poor.

600
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,156
- I'm gonna kill you!

601
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,532
I'm gonna kill you!

602
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,493
I'm gonna kill you!

603
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:09,413
(mellow jazzy music continues)

604
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,211
- You get the money?

605
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,339
You didn't get the money?

606
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,423
- He's crazy.
- Is in there?

607
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,258
Is he still in there?
- He's crazy.

608
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,550
- I’m gonna go and get it myself.

609
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,511
Is he still in there?
- You can't go in there, he's-

610
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,762
- What are we gonna do?

611
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,596
- I don't know.

612
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,681
- Do you have any money?
I don't have any money.

613
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:27,515
- Oh, Billy.

614
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,349
- Betty.

615
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,268
- Cut!

616
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,603
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

617
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,646
Not bad.

618
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:36,983
Not bad.

619
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,027
Now tomorrow we're going
to go back and do the scene

620
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,696
where you go in there after your money.

621
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:42,947
He's a sadist.

622
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,407
Remember that.

623
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,201
He's already hit you in the mouth once.

624
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,579
But he's got your money, and
you think that you can get it,

625
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,083
because you have such a
strong sexual hold over him.

626
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:57,545
You think that sex is a more
powerful force than pride.

627
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,381
Good night.

628
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,299
- Uh, Stanley.

629
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,011
Um, don't you think that
Scandelli's acting was a bit,

630
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,595
you know, excessive?

631
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,430
- No.

632
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,643
(Farris sighs)

633
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,686
- It's a wrap.

634
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,520
(Farris claps)

635
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,480
- So why did you give it up for?

636
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,024
- I just got tired of beating heads in

637
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,191
for a living, you know?

638
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,987
People watching and
screaming night after night.

639
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,573
I hated it.

640
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,824
- Sure. I can understand.

641
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,664
God. . .

642
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,916
She is so beautiful.

643
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,418
- Hey, stay cool, huh?

644
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,045
- Yeah, I'm cool, but.. .

645
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,465
She's just so beautiful.

646
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,217
- Hey, listen.

647
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,844
Don't sleep where you eat, kid.

648
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,099
(apple crunches)

649
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,562
(projector clicking)

650
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,438
- [Stanley] "Strange and Dangerous".

651
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,981
Scene 826, take two.

652
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,149
Marker.

653
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,985
(clapperboard clacks)

654
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,819
Action!

655
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,654
- Everybody's got a past.

656
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,199
Everybody's got something
they're ashamed of.

657
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,825
- I know.

658
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,661
But it's hard for a girl to
get her pride back after,

659
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,497
You know?

660
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,374
- It's not what you've done.

661
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,958
It's not who you've been.

662
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,794
It's what you can become.

663
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,838
Oh, Betty...

664
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,340
(projector clicks)

665
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,508
Believe in us.

666
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,971
Hey, I've been lookin' for you.

667
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,973
I just couldn't let you
leave without telling ya. ..

668
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,350
You were really beautiful

669
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,477
in that dance hall sequence tonight.

670
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,687
- Well, I don't know about that, but. ..

671
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,773
When I came out, and you
were among the dancers,

672
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,025
that look you gave me was such a help.

673
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,568
It's very difficult because. . .

674
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,529
I don't know if my
character is supposed to be

675
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,613
good or bad or what.

676
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,823
- Yeah, but I like that.

677
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,199
- Well, so do I.

678
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,909
I think she's both.

679
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,369
I think she does love you,

680
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,829
but her shame holds her back.

681
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,830
- Yeah.

682
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,832
- When she sees you, she loves you though.

683
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,875
And that's why that look
you gave me was such a help.

684
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,751
- Well, with you, it's easy.

685
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:02,795
(Stevie chuckles)

686
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,464
- Hold this for a sec, will you?

687
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,511
- I’ve been admiring your car here.

688
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,265
I’ve never even driven in a car like this.

689
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,099
- No?

690
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,226
- [Stevie] Well, where ya goin'?

691
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,060
(engine revs)

692
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,103
- Home. I'm beat.

693
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,813
- I guess that's it.

694
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:25,818
- Good night.
(engine sputters)

695
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,825
- Hey, Carol!

696
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,369
You forgot your script!

697
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,163
Shit.

698
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,752
- Mm. Very good.

699
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,338
(mellow music)

700
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,884
Did you put something in it?

701
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:50,718
- Vodka.

702
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,552
- Did you?
- Yeah.

703
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,138
- I hate it.
(Carol laughs)

704
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,891
(Frank laughing)

705
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,438
(soft jazz music)

706
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,952
- What do you think?

707
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,664
What do you guys think?

708
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,667
Should I call her?

709
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,504
Pretty flimsy excuse, huh?

710
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,426
She might need it.
(siren faintly blares)

711
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,844
Yeah, I guess you're right.

712
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,845
I'll give it a shot.

713
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,182
(mellow piano music)

714
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,684
(phone rings)

715
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,562
- Who is that?

716
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:47,066
(phone continues ringing)

717
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,907
- Hello?

718
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,493
(phone clicks)

719
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,331
(mellow piano music continues)

720
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,625
If a man answers, hang up.

721
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:14,510
Right?

722
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,267
(change clatters)

723
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,396
Did I tell you about a new building today?

724
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,064
- No.

725
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:27,898
- Duplex.

726
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,776
(phone rings)

727
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,777
On Willowby.

728
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:37,658
Mm.
(phone continues ringing)

729
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,623
- Hello?

730
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,547
(mellow piano music continues)

731
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,381
Hello?

732
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,303
(phone clicks)

733
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:03,726
(phone clacks)
(mellow piano music continues)

734
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:24,496
(mellow piano music continues)

735
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,002
Two units.

736
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,464
Two bedrooms upstairs.

737
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,966
(phone rings)

738
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,853
(phone continues ringing)

739
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,993
(soft dramatic music)

740
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:27,142
(chairs clattering)
(dramatic music)

741
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,988
(intense piercing music swells)

742
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:45,786
- Hey, gorgeous.

743
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,789
- Hey.

744
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,623
- Sleep well?

745
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,042
- Okay. You?

746
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,919
- Nah, I counted sheep all night. Here.

747
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,131
- Thanks.

748
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,465
- I tried to call you last night, but-

749
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,217
- So it was you.

750
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,969
- I'm sorry, but I thought
you might need your script.

751
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,887
- That's a private number!

752
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,769
- Go ahead, baby. Get outta here.

753
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,937
I'll keep him busy for a while.

754
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,063
Don't worry about me.

755
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,064
- I can't. I can't.

756
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:14,898
I won't.

757
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,610
- How did I ever fall for a dame like you?

758
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,987
- Cut!

759
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,071
Jesus Christ.

760
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,536
How much do you two really
know about each other, hm?

761
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:28,871
How much?

762
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:29,705
- What do you mean?

763
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,040
- I mean that this scene requires love.

764
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,333
You give me love!

765
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,586
You do it again, and you do it right!

766
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,005
Right away.

767
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:38,839
Right away!

768
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,340
Go, go.

769
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,341
- [Speaker] Rolling.

770
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,637
- [Stanley] Action.

771
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,847
(door clatters)

772
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:47,681
- Go ahead, baby.

773
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,932
Get outta here. Get outta here!

774
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,059
I'll keep him busy for a while.
Don't worry about me. Go!

775
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,311
- I can't. I can't.

776
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,145
I won't!

777
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,648
- How did I ever fall for a dame like you?

778
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,483
- Cut.

779
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:03,739
Okay.

780
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,742
Ms. Redding, I want a word with you.

781
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,619
Farris, prepare the boxing sequence.

782
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,078
I want the low angles.

783
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,455
- My left is so solid.

784
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,916
But my right is, I don't know.

785
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,375
- Listen, you gotta feel it.

786
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,627
Power is in the heart.

787
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,005
- Yeah, I know, but how
do I get it in the arm?

788
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,965
(bag thuds)

789
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,008
- Put it in the ring.

790
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,302
Ready to shoot in, uh.. .

791
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,429
One minute.

792
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,265
- [Stanley] Okay, Esteban.

793
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,600
Show me what you've done.

794
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,434
- [Esteban] Okay.

795
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,478
The first one looks like
he's gonna lose, right?

796
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,312
- [Stanley] Yeah.

797
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,190
- It looks like he's allowing
himself to be hit on purpose.

798
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,024
Okay.

799
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,025
Well, here's the sequence.

800
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,276
You lead off, right?

801
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,277
Remember.

802
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,153
Okay, let's do it.

803
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,997
One, two, three, four,

804
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,457
five, six, seven.

805
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,671
- [Stanley] Okay, fine, fine.

806
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,756
Now do it again.

807
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,924
Wait a minute.

808
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,970
Okay, do it again.

809
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:08,804
Action.

810
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,854
- One, two, three, four,

811
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,272
five, six, seven.

812
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,983
(Stevie grunts)

813
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:21,817
- Okay.

814
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,194
All right.

815
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,529
Let's go for one now, all right?

816
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,989
For real.

817
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,448
I want some good, hard blows.

818
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,825
You understand?

819
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,785
Hard, hard.

820
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,412
Do not hurt his face.

821
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,246
Got it?

822
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,080
- Yeah, I got it.

823
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,040
- Stevie, give it to him with some power.

824
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,375
One more thing.

825
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,419
Try not to step on my face.

826
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,045
All right?

827
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,630
And action!

828
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,096
Oh, cut.

829
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:51,930
Cut.

830
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,562
What is it with you, Blake?

831
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,690
I want you to be tender,
you look like a killer.

832
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,860
I want you to be a boxer,
you look like a baby.

833
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:05,694
Do it again.

834
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,196
Right away, please.

835
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,197
- Rolling!

836
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,411
- And. ..

837
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,245
Action!

838
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,794
(gloves thudding)

839
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,339
Cut!

840
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,173
Cut!

841
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,175
Reload.

842
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,092
- [Farris] Reload.

843
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,095
- Thanks a lot, Blake.

844
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:32,930
Thank you.

845
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,400
(soft string music)

846
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,039
- How's it going?

847
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,082
- Badly.

848
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,541
You can go home, Ms. Redding.

849
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,252
- Mind if I stay?

850
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,297
- Suit yourself.

851
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,636
(soft string music continues)

852
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:18,892
- All right.

853
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,935
Right away, please.

854
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,145
Here we go.

855
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:22,980
Action.

856
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,610
(gloves thudding)

857
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,738
Oh, cut!

858
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,324
You guys, back to your corners.

859
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,703
Esteban, come here.

860
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,167
Esteban, you're not doing your job.

861
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,170
This is not what I call fighting, hm?

862
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,548
I hired you as the fight arranger,

863
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:52,217
I gave you a part in my movie.

864
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,844
No fight.

865
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,220
Broken promises.

866
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,681
I’m very unhappy.

867
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,310
- Want them fired up, huh?

868
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,145
- Quite so.

869
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,703
- So why do they call you Tony "The Rose"?

870
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,206
'Cause after every fight, I
still smell sweet, you know?

871
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,124
- Like her?

872
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,295
- Like that.

873
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,641
- Looks like you got some competition.

874
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,442
- Okay. Right away, please.

875
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:55,489
Quiet on the set.

876
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,323
- [Farris] Rolling!

877
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,075
- And action!

878
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,539
Oh, that's great.

879
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,957
Great!

880
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,794
(gloves thudding)

881
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,721
Are you writing scripts or what?

882
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,140
In my script, he knocks you out!

883
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,068
- This picture could be so good.

884
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,570
We could become like Bogart and Bacall,

885
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,240
like Tracy and Hepburn.

886
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,741
- Well, who knows?

887
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,827
Who knows?

888
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,120
It's a lovely thought, anyhow.

889
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,538
- Well, anything's possible.

890
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,248
- Sure.

891
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,668
You should've seen his face.

892
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:50,502
- Whose?

893
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:53,130
- Our director's when
you decked the other guy.

894
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,089
- That was nothing.

895
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,008
- What's the matter?

896
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,719
- Nothin'.

897
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,848
- Yes, there is. I can tell.

898
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:03,682
- You can?

899
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,725
- Yes, I can.

900
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,311
- Hey, well, that's the way
it should be between us.

901
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,188
- What do you mean?
- That's the way it should be.

902
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,398
I mean, for the work.

903
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,611
We should have some kind of understanding.

904
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,113
You know, rapport.

905
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,739
- What's rapport?

906
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,408
- That's something without words.

907
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,703
That's the way I see Billy and Betty.

908
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,207
That's why they fall in love so quickly.

909
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,376
Haven't you ever had that?

910
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,714
- I don't know.

911
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,593
- Well, I had it once.

912
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,386
I met this girl.

913
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,847
That night, she was living with me.

914
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,015
She stayed two years.

915
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:46,975
And then...

916
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,310
(Stevie snaps)

917
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,936
She was gone.

918
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,146
Never even said goodbye.

919
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,611
What's the matter?

920
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,196
- Nothin'.

921
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,822
- Yes, there is. I can tell.

922
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,032
- There is nothing the matter.

923
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,533
- Yes, there is. I can tell.

924
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,369
Do you know how I can tell?

925
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,455
You and me.

926
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,751
We have rapport.

927
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,505
(soft saxophone music)

928
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,757
- I know.

929
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:22,969
You put the idea in my head!
He doesn't mean anything to me!

930
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,429
He's a nobody! I love you!

931
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,056
You know what I want, I want you.

932
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:26,932
(Scandelli grunts)

933
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,351
I want you, and kids, and a family. ..

934
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,436
- What you taking me for, Betty?

935
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,605
A 14 carat idiot, or what?

936
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,693
- She's so good at fear, so bad at love.

937
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:40,737
(Scandelli yells)

938
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,655
- [Carol] He doesn't mean anything to me!

939
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,031
- What am I gonna do about that?

940
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,825
(Scandelli grunts)

941
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,452
- What are you taking me for?

942
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,872
What are you taking me for? An idiot?

943
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,082
(dramatic string music)

944
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:52,916
Or what?

945
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,047
- Hey, I really miss ya.

946
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,929
Carol?

947
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,763
I never see you.

948
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,446
Carol?

949
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,240
Goddamn it, I'm talking to you!

950
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,288
(Carol sighs)

951
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,587
Are you behaving yourself?

952
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,426
- Oh, Frank, please
don't start that again.

953
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,646
(door slams)

954
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:01,985
- [Reporter] Good morning.

955
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,071
This is Dick Whittingham
with our daily story record.

956
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,032
After this, we give all
kinds of prizes away,

957
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,199
with a chance to win. . .

958
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,041
- Why are you always depressed these days?

959
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,959
How do you think it makes me feel?

960
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,301
(chair clatters)

961
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,266
- Here.

962
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,101
Maybe this will make you feel better.

963
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,561
(cash clatters)

964
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,147
(mellow music)

965
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,458
(mellow music continues)

966
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,977
(mellow music continues)

967
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,858
- [Woman] Oh, please don't!

968
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,403
No, don't throw us out!

969
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,320
No, no, no!

970
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,410
- [Frank] Come on!

971
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,079
(woman shrieks)

972
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,291
(Frank grunts)

973
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,461
(woman shrieks)

974
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,712
(mellow music)

975
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,547
- Hi.

976
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,007
- Hi!

977
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,009
- How about a kiss, baby?

978
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:54,472
(mellow music continues)

979
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,726
- All right, now this is THE kiss.

980
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,979
Up until now, you've
resisted the attraction.

981
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:05,608
But now all pretense, all
resistance has evaporated.

982
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,819
You are fleshy magnets.

983
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,362
And make me believe it.

984
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,989
Make us believe it.

985
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,699
Make Scandelli believe it.

986
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,575
All right?

987
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,326
Action.

988
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,999
(sensual saxophone music)

989
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,126
Blake, where's your shirt?

990
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,043
Blake, cut.

991
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,462
Blake.

992
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,629
Blake!

993
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,548
Where is your shirt?

994
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,382
- Excuse me?

995
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,842
- Where is your shirt?

996
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:31,759
- Oh, oh.
(Carol laughs)

997
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
I'm sorry, I forgot.

998
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,887
- Get a shirt, please.

999
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:35,930
- Don't you like my pecs?

1000
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:36,806
- Get a shirt!

1001
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,059
Raise the camera higher, would you?

1002
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,102
All right, action.

1003
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,773
No, cut.

1004
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,609
Haven't you ever been in love?

1005
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,443
Try it again.

1006
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,153
Please.

1007
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:50,987
Action.

1008
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,282
No, no, no.
(Carol laughs)

1009
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,116
Cut.

1010
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,451
Hold her face gently.

1011
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,829
(Carol laughs)
Tenderly, you imbecile!

1012
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,165
- You can't get to me by
calling me an imbecile.

1013
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,249
- Right. Thank you.

1014
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,083
Action.

1015
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,877
- Can I ask you one question?

1016
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,003
Should I use my tongue?

1017
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:08,796
- [Stanley] Ask her that.

1018
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,089
- No, I don't wanna do anything with-

1019
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,592
- [Stanley] Don't use your
tongue, we can't see it.

1020
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,551
- I never thought of that.

1021
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,385
- And we don't know where it's been.

1022
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,637
So if you'll please just.. .

1023
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:19,307
(person laughs)
(Stevie chuckles)

1024
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,476
Now reverse sides, change sides.

1025
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,811
Thank you.

1026
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,646
Action.

1027
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,106
Thank you.

1028
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:27,941
Let her...

1029
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:28,775
Okay.

1030
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,901
Other way with the nose.

1031
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,612
I realize there's a lot of it.

1032
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:33,905
- Other way with the nose?

1033
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,741
- [Stanley] Yes, on her left
cheek, as opposed to obscuring-

1034
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,784
- Like this?

1035
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,370
- [Stanley] Mr. Blake, it
is funny, we're all tired,

1036
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,579
but you're hiding her face.

1037
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,622
Carol, don't let him hide your face.

1038
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:43,456
- I got it.

1039
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,332
So you want my nose on this side,

1040
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,167
so I don't block with my nose.

1041
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,085
Like this.

1042
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,378
- Farris. Where's Farris?

1043
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:51,756
Okay, stop.

1044
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,552
Okay. Change frame.

1045
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,096
- Like this?
- Right. Better.

1046
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,393
- [Stanley] Okay, change
your heads around,

1047
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,895
so your head is toward camera.

1048
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,729
- Hm?

1049
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,564
- [Stanley] No, no, no!

1050
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,566
Turn your lips to the other side.

1051
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,150
(Stanley laughs)

1052
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:11,985
- I'm sorry, but-

1053
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,444
- Come on, face 90 degrees to the camera.

1054
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,279
- Can I. ..

1055
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,113
Okay.

1056
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,115
- [Stanley] Can you kiss
turning your head the other way?

1057
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,741
The other way.

1058
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,326
Right.

1059
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,661
No, no, other way, sorry.

1060
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,745
You're blocking her from the camera.

1061
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,872
Could I touch her breasts?

1062
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,416
(crew laughing)

1063
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,250
- [Stanley] No, you can't.

1064
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,376
Please, Blake.

1065
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:29,294
(crew laughing)

1066
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,670
Quiet, everybody.

1067
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,385
- Hey, would you look at that?

1068
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,386
Real life.

1069
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,722
(dog barks)

1070
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,309
- I can't stand him.

1071
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,143
- [Stevie] Who?

1072
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,936
- Our director is so manipulative.

1073
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,107
- I wish you'd stay with me tonight.

1074
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,442
- Oh, Stevie.

1075
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:53,401
- Somebody else?

1076
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:55,695
- Maybe.

1077
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,489
- Guy who answered the phone?

1078
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,366
- Don't wanna talk about it.

1079
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,868
- Maybe I wanna talk about it.

1080
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,871
- Dunno what to say.

1081
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,668
I wish this picture would never end.

1082
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,643
- $2,271 and 52 cents.

1083
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:33,149
$2,299 and 99 cents.

1084
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,069
$3,324 and 31 cents.

1085
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,030
$3,999 and 44 cents.

1086
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:39,864
- Is she married?

1087
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,199
- Wait.

1088
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,743
- $2,271 and 52 cents.

1089
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,663
$2,299 and 99 cents.

1090
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:50,416
$3,324 and 31 cents.

1091
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,542
4,000...

1092
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,504
ls who married, Blake?

1093
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,672
- Carol.

1094
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,173
Is she married?

1095
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,926
- I don't think that's
any of your business.

1096
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,010
- [Stanley] Goddamn it!

1097
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,055
Damn it! Damn it!

1098
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:07,016
I cannot understand why you can't get

1099
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,768
anything done in this country.

1100
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,812
- [Farris] What's the problem this time?

1101
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,271
- [Stanley] Catholics!

1102
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,441
Monday is some goddamn Catholic holiday!

1103
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,985
So they can print our stuff tonight,

1104
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,446
but they can't release it until Tuesday.

1105
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,280
Which means that we-

1106
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,573
- So do it on Tuesday.

1107
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,536
- Farris, I've had a brilliant idea.

1108
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,870
I'll view it on Tuesday.

1109
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,916
Blake, what are you doing here?

1110
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,752
- Asking questions about Carol.

1111
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:38,339
- Excellent.

1112
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,677
Good.

1113
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:43,511
Good.

1114
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,931
Blake, go home and get some rest.

1115
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,766
Tomorrow we're gonna do the chase sequence

1116
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,102
with you and Scandelli.

1117
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:51,936
No Carol.

1118
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,481
No Carol.

1119
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,610
(soft string music)

1120
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,288
(dramatic string music)

1121
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,567
(birds faintly chirping)

1122
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,390
(dramatic string music)

1123
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:42,839
(dramatic string music continues)

1124
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,135
(speed bag clatters)

1125
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,602
- No money, no light.

1126
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,436
That's the rule.

1127
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:02,024
(speed bag clatters)

1128
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,361
- Blake!

1129
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,195
Stop it!

1130
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:13,286
(speed bag clatters)
(tense music)

1131
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,380
Go talk to him.

1132
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,969
(footsteps pattering)

1133
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:42,607
(tense music continues)

1134
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,404
(footsteps pattering)

1135
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,365
- Does Stevie know what's going on?

1136
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,827
- Certainly not.

1137
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,661
- Good.

1138
00:56:58,624 --> 00:56:59,707
It will come.

1139
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,293
It's just-

1140
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,127
- Sure.

1141
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,715
(tense music fades)

1142
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,401
(straps clacking)

1143
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,580
(bell jingles)

1144
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:21,539
(bell jingles)

1145
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,927
(phone rings)

1146
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,101
- Hello?

1147
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,147
Yes, we'll have someone right away.

1148
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,441
The money's here! It's at the gate!

1149
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,442
- All right!

1150
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,276
(Stanley claps)

1151
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,986
Back to work, everybody.

1152
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:52,862
Blake!

1153
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,405
Get down here instantly.

1154
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,240
Farris, call Ms. Redding!

1155
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,662
I'd like to do a walk by.

1156
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,123
I'd like this to be a
first date improvisation.

1157
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,834
Thank you.

1158
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:09,837
Eventually Scandelli and his
folks are gonna be in this car.

1159
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,131
Ms. Redding?

1160
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,508
Ms. Redding, you don't
wanna look in the car.

1161
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:18,679
- Hello?

1162
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,513
- [Frank] Hello.

1163
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,390
- Can I help you?

1164
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,226
- [Frank] May I speak
with Ms. Redding, please?

1165
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,061
- Hold on.

1166
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,409
- Now you're coming down the street. ..

1167
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,243
No, no, no.

1168
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,787
You and Carol are on your first date.

1169
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:46,874
And you're just gonna
be walking by the car.

1170
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,001
- There's someone on the
phone for Ms. Redding.

1171
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,712
- She's busy.

1172
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,589
Could you take a message?

1173
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,049
- Okay.
- Save it for the reel.

1174
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,135
You guys are just overjoyed
to be out with each other.

1175
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:58,969
Something. . .

1176
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:02,640
Okay?

1177
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:03,557
You're not gonna see that.

1178
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,850
You're not.

1179
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:08,854
(Stevie and Stanley chattering)

1180
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,691
- Hello?

1181
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:13,526
- [Frank] Carol?

1182
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,402
- No, it's me again. She's busy.

1183
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,445
Give me a number and I'll-

1184
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,072
- [Frank] Who are you?
- Nobody.

1185
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,698
- [Frank] Well, listen
to me, I'm Frank Silva.

1186
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,408
I put up the money for this show.

1187
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,871
(soft saxophone music)

1188
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,419
(Stanley chattering)

1189
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,927
- It's Frank Silva.

1190
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:42,221
He says he wants-
- Wait.

1191
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,055
Just wait.

1192
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:46,976
Stanley.

1193
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,945
It's Silva on the phone for Carol.

1194
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,656
Uh, the waitress heard.

1195
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,033
- She heard?

1196
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,161
- Yeah, she picked up the phone.

1197
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:07,621
(Stanley clears throat)

1198
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,455
- Okay.

1199
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:12,877
Get Carol to take the call,
and I'll talk to the girl.

1200
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,594
Hello.
- Hello.

1201
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,762
I'm Stanley. I’m the director.

1202
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,014
- Hi, Stanley.

1203
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,223
- What's your name?

1204
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,057
- Shirley.

1205
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,350
- [Stanley] Shirley, you're very lovely.

1206
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,351
- [Shirley] Thank you.

1207
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,735
- Hello.

1208
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,028
- Carol?

1209
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:39,862
- Yes.

1210
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:41,906
(Frank sighs)

1211
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:42,781
- I'm sorry.

1212
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,242
- You should be. You just
stopped the whole show.

1213
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,162
- About this morning.

1214
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:49,538
- Give me some air, Frank.

1215
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,873
Let me breathe.

1216
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,962
I gotta get back to work.
They're all looking at me.

1217
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,672
- You're interested in films?

1218
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,506
- Mm.

1219
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,133
Mhm.

1220
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,009
- Hm.

1221
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:05,638
Did it ever occur to you
that you could be in films?

1222
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:09,725
- Well, I always kind of wanted to.

1223
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,393
- Did you?
- I dunno if I can.

1224
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,229
- You can.

1225
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,274
- We're very busy, Frank.

1226
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,109
(Frank sighs)

1227
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,527
- Well. ..

1228
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,362
- Goodbye.

1229
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,574
- Bye.

1230
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,536
(phone clatters)

1231
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:41,382
(soft music)

1232
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,135
- [Carol] I thought it went well tonight.

1233
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,845
- [Stevie] For you.

1234
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:47,805
(Carol chuckles)

1235
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,932
- You're always saying that, "For me."

1236
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,016
What about you?

1237
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:51,892
- Eh, you know.

1238
01:02:53,645 --> 01:02:55,688
I'll say it for you, you say it for me.

1239
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:58,691
(Carol chuckles)

1240
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,150
- Mm, fresh air.

1241
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:00,985
Ah.

1242
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:06,824
You know, every evening
I stay in costume longer.

1243
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:09,368
(soft music continues)

1244
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,953
- It's almost over, kid.

1245
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,625
- Let's go and sit over there.

1246
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:22,548
(soft music continues)

1247
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,104
- [Stanley] Cut.

1248
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,273
Start it over, please.

1249
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,774
You were fine, Ms. Redding.

1250
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,901
- [Carol] I wonder why
he always wears black.

1251
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,361
- [Stevie] Mourning for his life.

1252
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,571
- [Carol] Huh?

1253
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,781
- That's a Chekhov play, "The Seagull".

1254
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,615
You read that?

1255
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,411
- [Carol] You're smart.

1256
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:56,081
Read things, and people like
you, and you make 'em laugh.

1257
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,208
- [Stevie] Well, I'm an actor.

1258
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:00,002
I'm a faker, you know.

1259
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:02,713
- [Carol] Yeah, but I can't do that.

1260
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,173
- [Stevie] People know who I am.

1261
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,091
They know where I come from.

1262
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,551
Nobody knows anything about you,

1263
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,721
so it's kinda hard for
them to be friendly.

1264
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,891
- [Carol] Mm.

1265
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,434
- [Stevie] Same with the director.

1266
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,020
I mean, I don't know
anything about him either.

1267
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,274
- Do you think he lives with Farris?

1268
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:27,196
(Carol chuckles)

1269
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,907
- I don't think he lives
any place but here.

1270
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:32,910
I think when he's gone
from here, he's, um...

1271
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,874
.. .he's like a wino without his wine.

1272
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,587
He has to drink us to feel good.

1273
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:44,713
- [Carol] ls it always like this?

1274
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,299
I mean, every time you make a movie?

1275
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,926
- [Stevie] Movies are like dreams.

1276
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,010
There's no rules.

1277
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,387
- [Carol] And when it's over?

1278
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:52,846
- [Stevie] Sometimes
you don't wanna wake up,

1279
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,681
and see yourself as you really are.

1280
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,351
I guess it depends who you're playing,

1281
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:58,977
who's playing your role.

1282
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,688
Anyway, I'll tell you something.

1283
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:04,400
It's been fun working with
you, getting to know you.

1284
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,234
- [Carol] Yeah.

1285
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:07,945
- And I'll be damned if. . .

1286
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,032
I'm gonna let some fun in my life end,

1287
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,742
just 'cause the movie's gonna end.

1288
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:19,248
(soft music continues)

1289
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,082
- Yeah.

1290
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:25,337
(soft music continues)

1291
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,637
- Carol?

1292
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:34,471
- Who's that?

1293
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:39,268
Kiss her properly, we can't fake this!

1294
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,187
Okay, now the other way.

1295
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,522
Try again.

1296
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,524
Blake, cut, Blake!

1297
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:47,526
- You want me to get started,
then you want me to stop.

1298
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:50,320
When I’m kissing her, it's hard to stop.

1299
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,155
- [Stanley] I understand.

1300
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,781
- Okay. I’m just apologizing.

1301
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,615
Okay.

1302
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,578
(soft music continues)

1303
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:58,412
- Who is it?

1304
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:01,582
Carol, don't.. .

1305
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,043
You're not being raped, darling.

1306
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,378
Return the attention.

1307
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,212
Damn.

1308
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,299
- Thank God we're almost finished.

1309
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:15,888
(flowers thudding)

1310
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,141
(soft music continues)

1311
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,197
(phone rings)

1312
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,621
(papers thwacking)

1313
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:41,455
- Yes.

1314
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,458
Oh, hello, Mr. Silva.

1315
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:45,292
How are you?

1316
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:48,629
But of cour.. .

1317
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,714
Certainly, that's no problem.

1318
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:57,012
Unfortunately, he's not
here right now, but...

1319
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,680
Oh, I can come over right away.

1320
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,517
No problem, Mr. Silva.

1321
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:14,988
- I'm worried.

1322
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:18,450
- [Farris] Oh?

1323
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,913
- I'm worried about my investment.

1324
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:29,002
- Well, really, there
is no need for concern.

1325
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,675
(phone faintly rings)

1326
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:35,509
- That's all.

1327
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:43,475
By the way...

1328
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,270
My cousin Jimmy wanted to know,

1329
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:49,982
could he come down and maybe
watch a couple days filming?

1330
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,160
- I gotta talk to you. This is serious.

1331
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,079
- I cut it this way, I cut it that way,

1332
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,831
it doesn't work, the alley is shit.

1333
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,541
- I just spoke to Silva, he's crazy.

1334
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:08,959
You better go talk to your boxer.

1335
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,419
- See, he uses her for bait.

1336
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,712
They don't get caught together.

1337
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:14,256
The boxer follows her down
here to the warehouse.

1338
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,924
- [Farris] He's a very dangerous man.

1339
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,343
- That's right. He's a very dangerous man.

1340
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,845
- Jesus Christ, Stanley!

1341
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,139
This is life I'm talkin' about!

1342
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,391
He's putting one of his
goddamn goons on the set!

1343
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,851
- And I'm trying to make a movie

1344
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,186
about a man and a woman
in love, and I want heat!

1345
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,355
- And you don't care
how you do it, do you?

1346
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,107
- Jesus Christ! I’m trying to work!

1347
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,695
- Oh, Sidney, I'm sorry.

1348
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:40,032
(dramatic string music)

1349
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,450
- No, you're not.

1350
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:53,086
(dramatic string music continues)

1351
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,820
(dramatic string music continues)

1352
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,535
- We're almost at the
end of your relationship.

1353
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,873
After this, it's all chase and violence.

1354
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:34,211
You've decided to leave New York together.

1355
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,463
You're meeting to discuss the last details

1356
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:38,131
in the courtyard of the tenement.

1357
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,259
Carol, you are afraid.

1358
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,178
You are very afraid.

1359
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,346
You know Scandelli.

1360
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,475
And as you talk, and as
you kiss before you part,

1361
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:49,726
you are aware.

1362
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,812
You are very aware.

1363
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:53,980
Maybe he's watching you.

1364
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:58,360
Maybe he's up there,
spying on the two of you.

1365
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,114
Carol, are you listening to me?

1366
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:04,658
- Yeah.

1367
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:10,580
(soft saxophone music)

1368
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:14,584
- First positions.

1369
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:21,466
Roll it.

1370
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,344
- [Crew] We have speed.

1371
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,600
- [Crew] "Strange and
Dangerous", scene 67, take one.

1372
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,601
Mark.

1373
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,270
(clapperboard clacks)

1374
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,104
- Action.

1375
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,403
- Meet me at the station.

1376
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:42,904
- Five o'clock, I'll be there.

1377
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:45,449
I love you.

1378
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:47,284
- Don't go, not yet.

1379
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:48,910
- I love you, but we must hurry.

1380
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,081
- Cut.

1381
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,301
Very good, Carol.

1382
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:05,135
Very good.

1383
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,598
We're done with you two for today.

1384
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:11,892
Everyone else take 1 0.

1385
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:20,442
- You ever notice how he
never mentions me anymore?

1386
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,735
I mean, it's always...

1387
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:22,903
"Very good, Carol.

1388
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:23,737
Excellent, Carol."

1389
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:24,571
Then. ..

1390
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:25,572
"Oh, thank you Stevie. Goodnight."

1391
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:26,406
(Carol chuckles)

1392
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,492
- He knows you've got more
confidence, that's all.

1393
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,619
- Oh, it goes quick, you know.

1394
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,828
Everything goes quick.

1395
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,414
Let's get a drink. Come on.

1396
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,290
- Maybe tomorrow.

1397
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:38,627
- Why maybe?

1398
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,297
- Good night, Stevie.

1399
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,726
- Oh, Shirley.

1400
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,978
I'd really like to speak to
you for one second. Could I?

1401
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:57,979
Just for one second.

1402
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,439
Come over here.

1403
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,652
Look, I know you know, and
obviously I need to know.

1404
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,320
So, where does she go at nights?

1405
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:07,531
- Home, I expect.

1406
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:08,824
- Well then, who called
her up the other day?

1407
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,116
- I've been told not to tell you anything.

1408
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:10,951
- Who told you?

1409
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:13,119
- Director.

1410
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,037
- Why?

1411
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,288
- I don't know.

1412
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,165
- Well, if you don't know,

1413
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,835
obviously it doesn't
make any sense to you.

1414
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,002
So why don't you just tell me?

1415
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,754
- He told me not to.

1416
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,172
- So what?

1417
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,383
- Well, I gave him my word.

1418
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,302
- What's it to you, Shirley?

1419
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,804
What, he promise you a big part

1420
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,848
in his next movie or something?

1421
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:33,682
- Uh huh.

1422
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,976
Said I was a natural.

1423
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:38,979
- Probably are.

1424
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,023
- I'm sorry.

1425
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,903
- I think you got it wrong, boss.

1426
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,698
I don't think nothing's happening at all.

1427
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,325
Actors, the whole crowd.

1428
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:55,078
They're too fuckin' busy
with the junk they're making

1429
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:56,997
to have time for anything else.

1430
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:01,793
And if the boy is having
an affair with anyone,

1431
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:03,587
my money's on a waitress down there.

1432
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,214
- Stay with it.

1433
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:08,675
- Do I have to?

1434
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,011
- I wanna know.

1435
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,896
(insects faintly chirping)

1436
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:37,662
- You're late.

1437
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:41,625
- I'm late?

1438
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,213
- Have you eaten?

1439
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,090
- Yeah.

1440
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,355
- In case you're interested,

1441
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,315
I'm doing my last scenes tomorrow.

1442
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:08,902
- Tomorrow?

1443
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:10,695
- Tomorrow night.

1444
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,406
- Why?

1445
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,950
- I don't know.

1446
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:17,327
Suddenly decided he had
enough to make a movie.

1447
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:33,927
(chair clatters)

1448
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:00,704
- Hi.

1449
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:05,458
Listen, when the movie ends...

1450
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:08,795
Do we end?

1451
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:12,674
Please, Carol.

1452
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,927
- [Crew] Redding and Blake!

1453
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,512
Redding and Blake.

1454
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,097
On stage immediately.

1455
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,141
- After work.

1456
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,685
- You wanna come back to my place?

1457
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:26,271
- No, let's talk here.

1458
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,606
- [Stevie] Here on the set?

1459
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:30,650
- Well, somewhere.

1460
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:34,696
- Your place or mine?

1461
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,449
- Mine, okay?

1462
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:39,701
- Okay.

1463
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,289
(soft dramatic music)

1464
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,217
(change clatters)

1465
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,887
(rotary clicks)

1466
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,183
- "For six months, she
was petted and spoiled.

1467
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,895
For the rest of the year, she
was thwarted and neglected.

1468
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,231
With such discrepancy
determined, inevitably,

1469
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,984
her whole outlook upon life.

1470
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,986
The conditions of her own home,

1471
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,864
refined and comfortable though it was,

1472
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:19,199
became repugnant to her.

1473
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,452
It was only the other life.

1474
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:26,831
The gay, sunny, butterfly
life that was tolerable."

1475
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:29,125
What do you think?

1476
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,545
- [Stevie] I don't understand

1477
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:33,880
- What's to understand?

1478
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:37,425
I was reading last night, and
I got an idea about Betty.

1479
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,429
- Oh.

1480
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,473
Oh, Scandelli.

1481
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:45,058
The dance hall.

1482
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:46,184
It's the last day, I'm forgetting.

1483
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,353
Plus, I can't concentrate.

1484
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,105
This guy's always. ..

1485
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,190
Farris.
- Farris.

1486
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:53,983
Poor, maligned Farris.

1487
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,028
You are appreciated, Farris.

1488
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,825
And action!

1489
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:04,244
(soft music)

1490
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,916
All right, focus.

1491
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,001
Second bar, come into it.

1492
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,468
Cutting right to the end.. .

1493
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,511
Leaving. . .

1494
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:24,597
Blake, long look.

1495
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,182
Stay put.

1496
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:29,602
And out the door, catch
her, and out, and cut.

1497
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:39,070
(soft music continues)

1498
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,867
Cut, print it.

1499
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,537
That's a wrap.

1500
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:50,206
(crew clapping)

1501
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,001
- [Farris] Ta-dah!

1502
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:56,880
- [Stanley] What's this? Hey hey!

1503
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,511
- [Crew] Thank you very much.

1504
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,770

It's not easy. I'm not
a very strong person.

1511
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:23,758
(soft soul music)

1512
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,233

1513
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,653
(Jimmy sighs)

1514
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:44,529

- [Jimmy] Home?

1519
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:15,852
- I wanna go home.

1520
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:16,769

1521
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,187
- I'm going home.

01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:25,778

(soft music)

1531
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:46,359
- I can't end five years in five minutes.

1532
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,070
- Call me later.

1533
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:49,904
- Tomorrow.

1534
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,202
- I'll come with you.

1535
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:57,453
- I'll call you tomorrow.

1536
01:21:58,872 --> 01:21:59,705
I promise.

1537
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,627
- What are you afraid of?

1538
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:09,465
(soft music continues)

(tense string music continues)

1542
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,053
- [Frank] Finished?

1543
01:22:58,974 --> 01:22:59,807
- Yes.

1544
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:12,862
- Congratulations.

1545
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:17,533
(glasses clinking)

1546
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,249
- I-
- There.. .

1547
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:29,879
(Frank sighs)

1548
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:35,968
There's something very
important I want to say to you.

1549
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:37,386
Please sit down.

1550
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,396
You know. ..

1551
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:53,027
When you and me first.. .

1552
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:00,660
I picked you up.

1553
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,998
I knew I was a convenience for you.

1554
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:08,626
I gave you a place to
stay, took care of ya.

1555
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,255
You were a convenience for me.

1556
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:17,927
But in the past few weeks, I realized. ..

1557
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,307
It wasn't like that anymore.

1558
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,396
At least, not for me.

1559
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,442
(soft dramatic music)

1560
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,278
I'm gonna take you back to New York.

1561
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:45,621
(soft dramatic music continues)

1562
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,791
I want you to marry me.

1563
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:54,714
(soft dramatic music continues)

1564
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:56,048
What do you say?

1565
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:02,763
(soft dramatic music fades)

1566
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,622
(change clatters)

1567
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,458
(rotary clacking)

1568
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,930
(phone rings)

1569
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:14,627
- Where is she?

1570
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:15,753
- Where's who?

1571
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,129
- Carol.

1572
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,881
- She's in here, Stevie. In here.

1573
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:20,049
- Just finished cutting it.

1574
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,051
- You and Carol, good or bad,

1575
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:24,512
pinned down forever on celluloid,

1576
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:25,763
where you'll never grow old.

1577
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,348
- I wanna know where she's gone.

1578
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:29,350
I wanna know where she is now.

1579
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:30,935
I've tried her at home. I've-

1580
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:33,479
- Stevie, forget about her and move on.

1581
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,272
There's a wrap on that.

1582
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,233
You're a good actor.

1583
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,109
- Movies.

1584
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,404
Haven't you got anything
else in your life?

1585
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,409
- Would you like to come to the viewing

1586
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,160
and see if it was all worth it?

1587
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:52,373
- No.

1588
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,666
Thanks.

1589
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:54,583
- Better hurry, Stanley.

1590
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:56,585
He's very keen on punctuality.

1591
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:57,795
- See you around, Blake.

1592
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:00,464
- Wait a minute.

1593
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,091
You got what you wanted.

1594
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:03,676
I gotta know where she is.

1595
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:08,264
I know about the money,
I know about Silva,

1596
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:09,181
I know everything!

1597
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,063
We had plans.

1598
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:18,357
- She's gone, Stevie.

1599
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:21,944
I've tried reaching her too.

1600
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:22,778
She's just gone.

1601
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:25,823
I wish I could help.

1602
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:31,954
(soft dramatic string music)

1603
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:43,007
- [Stevie] Well, I can hardly believe it,

1604
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,383
but I’m leaving New York.

1605
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:47,553
Giving up boxing.

1606
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:49,263
Had to, under the circumstances.

1607
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,767
Betty.. .

1608
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:54,977
I guess she never really
loved me after all.

1609
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,981
I ain't seen her since that night.

1610
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:02,109
I wonder if she holds it
against me 'cause of Scandelli.

1611
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,488
I was just trying to take the danger away.

1612
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,992
I guess it just goes to show you,

1613
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:12,495
you can't do a woman's thinking for her.

1614
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:16,874
It just comes back to get you every time.

1615
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,797
It's just like boxing, being in love.

1616
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:25,758
Sometimes you get knocked down by it,

1617
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:26,842
and you get right up.

1618
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,054
Sometimes you get knocked out.

1619
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:35,643
And you lie there, and it
just goes right over you.

1620
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:39,688
Damn.

1621
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:42,441
I'll miss that girl.

1622
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:48,239
(dramatic saxophone music)

1623
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:56,330
- Billy, Billy!

1624
01:28:56,331 --> 01:29:00,668
- Betty, Betty!

1625
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:05,089
(dramatic saxophone music continues)

1626
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,598
- Wow.

1627
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:16,934
Now that's a movie.

1628
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,103
You should be damned proud of yourself!

1629
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,313
- I am.

1630
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:24,567
And if you think that's
good, listen to this.

1631
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,239
Vegas.

1632
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:31,323
You like Vegas?

1633
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:35,035
Six desperate men, two beautiful women.

1634
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,538
One good, one evil.

1635
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:38,873
$2 million.

1636
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:42,918
A split second meticulously planned heist.

1637
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:43,836
- At a casino.

1638
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:45,379
- Time.

1639
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,714
Put your watch to your ear.

1640
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:52,845
That noise you hear is time running out.

1641
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,263
Do you know why time is running out?

1642
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:58,183
Because tomorrow, at 12 noon, MG and M,

1643
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:01,061
That is Metro and Goldwyn and Mayer,

1644
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,397
is closing this deal!

1645
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,816
- I'm surprised you
didn't come to me first.

1646
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:10,988
- Farris, speak to this man!

1647
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,364
Speak to him!

1648
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:13,908
There may still be time.

1649
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:14,742
Speak to him.

1650
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:24,501
- Here's the deal.

1651
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:33,344
