1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:03,791
(dramatic orchestral music)

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,916
(music continues)

3
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,791
(music softens)

4
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,249
- [Narrator] Many years ago
when the Commodore built it,

5
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:13,541
it had been one of the
show places of New Bristol,

6
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,541
11 Crescent Drive.

7
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:20,207
That's how the house was still
listed in the city directory,

8
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,499
but it was a dead address.

9
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:26,749
It had been barred, locked, and
shuttered for over 12 years.

10
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:28,999
Thousands of days had dawned without a ray

11
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,291
of sunshine striking through its windows.

12
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,207
It stood among the neighbouring
homes, dark and blind,

13
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,707
and almost forgotten.

14
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,041
From a certain window
in the house next door,

15
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:44,249
the crescent seemed deserted,

16
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,707
yet not quite deserted.

17
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,416
An old woman was crossing the street,

18
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,999
bundled against the rain.

19
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,332
In front of the empty house,

20
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,207
suddenly she paused, surprised,

21
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,541
and stared at something she saw,

22
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,999
a light in a place where
no light should have been.

23
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,832
It moved behind the boarded windows.

24
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,166
It reached the wall.

25
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,707
It should have stopped
there, but it didn't.

26
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,249
It went on through into
the house next door,

27
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,291
and then she saw why.

28
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,666
Below her, dimly through
the rain stained window,

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,249
a man appeared.

30
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:30,541
She saw him stoop and lift something heavy

31
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,957
and set it in place.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,332
(gate creaking)

33
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,166
He must have heard her,

34
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,707
for suddenly he turned.

35
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,749
When the light hit her face,

36
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,249
she stumbled and dropped something.

37
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,207
(watch thuds)

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,166
A small gold watch.

39
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,207
It was probably the only thing
of value she had to her name.

40
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:51,291
Frightened as she was,
she stayed to look for it

41
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,916
just a little too long.

42
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,791
Above her, a door opened.

43
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,957
The door of number 10 Crescent Drive.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,749
(dramatic music)

45
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,457
(music intensifies)

46
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:39,332
(Alberta panting)
(pensive music)

47
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:50,082
(Alberta gasps)
(suspenseful music)

48
00:03:55,708 --> 00:04:00,707
(Alberta screams)
(dramatic music)

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,582
- Taxi?

50
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,832
Number 10, Crescent Drive.

51
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:24,957
(anticipatory music)
(train rumbling)

52
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,832
(light music)

53
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,457
(suspenseful music)

54
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,707
(light music)

55
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,749
(bell rings)

56
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:11,832
- What do you want?

57
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:12,666
- She wants in.

58
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,957
What do you think she wants?

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,999
- [Liz] I'm your new governess.

60
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,499
- We've got a governess.

61
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,291
- Sure you gave the right address, Miss?

62
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,207
- There it is.

63
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:22,582
Fielding, number 10, Crescent Drive.

64
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,082
- And they got a governess.

65
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,291
- Yes?

66
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,541
Oh, you should be Miss Howard.

67
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,416
Come in.

68
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,291
- [Liz] Thank you.

69
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,582
- You'll find Mr. Fielding in the library.

70
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,666
He's expecting you.

71
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,749
- Mr. Fielding?

72
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,832
- What is it?

73
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,332
- I'm Elizabeth Howard.

74
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,832
- Take a chair, Miss Howard.

75
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,541
(phone ringing)

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,082
- Shall I answer it?

77
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:18,999
- Why?

78
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:20,707
It'll stop ringing after awhile.

79
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,332
(ringing stops)

80
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,249
See?

81
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,291
- Perhaps you don't remember.

82
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,832
The agency in Boston sent
me here as a governess.

83
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,332
- [David] Uh huh.

84
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,999
- Well, aren't you even
going to look at me?

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,832
- Sure.

86
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,207
You're too young to know
anything about children.

87
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:49,666
- I'm sure I'm not.
- The agency said you were 25.

88
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,999
- You're not 25, are you?

89
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:52,749
- Well, no, I'm not.
- You're nothing like 25.

90
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,916
Have you ever had a job
as a governess before?

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,749
- No, but-

92
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,082
- Have you ever had any kind of a job?

93
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,041
- Yes, I have but-

94
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,916
- Don't you ever finish a sentence?

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,666
- Yes, if I'm allowed to.

96
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,791
- Okay, let's start all over.

97
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,582
Sit down, tell me about yourself.

98
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,291
- My home was in Sharon.

99
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,582
I went to Boston a year ago

100
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,207
and worked on a newspaper,

101
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,499
then I tried advertising for awhile.

102
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,832
- You didn't like it?

103
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,666
- I was fired.

104
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,791
- I see.

105
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:25,041
- I was never really trained for anything.

106
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:28,041
My father died suddenly
while I was at college.

107
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:28,999
- [David] And your mother?

108
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,582
- She died when I was a child.

109
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,457
- Well, Miss Howard,
you're young and pretty,

110
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,499
and you seem intelligent.

111
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:38,999
What makes you wanna be a governess?

112
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,916
- I'm fond of children, Mr. Fielding.

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,999
- You think that's enough?

114
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,082
- Yes, I do.

115
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,707
- You don't know my children.

116
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,749
- Well, I've seen them.

117
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:46,832
- But seeing them's one thing,

118
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,791
and making them behave as something else.

119
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,041
- I'd like to try if you'll let me.

120
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,207
- Well, let's go up and meet them.

121
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,416
I did hope you'd be a
little more motherly.

122
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,999
- I'll be 22 in March.

123
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,749
- Remind me to congratulate you.

124
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,999
That's where they belong, behind bars.

125
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,707
After my wife died,

126
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,457
they went to live with their grandmother.

127
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,957
She didn't discipline them.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,041
She bribed them.

129
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,749
(Liz chuckles)

130
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,957
That's my room and that's the nursery.

131
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,749
And this is your room.

132
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,166
- Lily?

133
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,291
Lily?

134
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,999
- Were you wanting me, Mr. Fielding?

135
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,249
- Is there anyone else in
this house called Lily?

136
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:40,041
Why hasn't this room been done?

137
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,332
- Hasn't it?

138
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,416
- When?

139
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,541
Last year?

140
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,499
- Well, I'll...

141
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,999
I'll go and get the sweeper.

142
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,957
- Do you know how to run
a house, Miss Howard?

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,791
- Yes, of course.

144
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,249
- I wish you'd run this one.

145
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,791
A cheerful view, isn't it?

146
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:57,957
- [Liz] Cheerful?

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,332
- That's the Tygarth place.

148
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,291
It's been boarded up for 12 years.

149
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,957
Around here we call it
the Commodore's Folly.

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,249
I used to work for the old devil once.

151
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,416
This is Ellen's room.

152
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,999
Come on in here you two,

153
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,957
and say how do you do to Miss Howard.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,457
This is my little girl.

155
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:21,957
- Hello, Ellen.

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,916
- Hello.

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,916
- Barney?

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,082
- This is Dumbo.

159
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,249
- Hello, Dumbo.

160
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:28,249
- [David] Barney?

161
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,666
- Barney's a very disobedient boy.

162
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,499
- [Liz] Really?

163
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:33,416
- Mm hm.

164
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:37,249
- What are you doing, son?

165
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,332
Playing hard to get?

166
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,041
Come on, let's go out and be friends.

167
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:41,999
- Don't want to.

168
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,249
- Come on, she's all right.

169
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,541
Let's give her a chance.

170
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,249
- This is Teddy, and this is Virginia May.

171
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:50,582
- This is Barney.

172
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,999
- How do you do Barney?

173
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,249
- Well, I'll leave you to get acquainted.

174
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,041
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

175
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,666
- Maxine was prettier.

176
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,082
- Maxine was mean.

177
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,416
She wouldn't do my curls.

178
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,832
- And who is Maxine?

179
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,166
- Maxine's our governess.

180
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,999
She's coming back.

181
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,082
She told me so.

182
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,707
- I'm glad you're going to
live with us, Miss Howard.

183
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,166
I like you.

184
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,582
- Well, I hope you're
both going to like me.

185
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,291
(door closes)

186
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,791
- Would you like to see
my scrapbook, Miss Howard?

187
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,457
- I'd like to very much.

♪ There'll be some changes made ♪

189
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,249
- Barney's always playing that old record.

190
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:30,832
Maxine gave it to him.

191
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,041
Look, that's Donald Duck.

192
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,291
(Liz chuckles)

193
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,249
And that's Dopey,

194
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,457
and that's Grumpy, the cross one.

195
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,666
Snow White.

196
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,957
Isn't she pretty?

197
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,499
- She's lovely.

198
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:49,957
- He was in love with her.

199
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,457
- He was?
- Mm hm.

200
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,249
- And what's this Ellen?

201
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,166
- Salem Alley.

202
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,499
That's Alberta.

203
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,791
- [Liz] Alberta?

204
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,749
- That's her there.

205
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,082
She's dead.

206
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,832
The man from the empty
house isn't in the picture.

207
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,041
- [Liz] What man?

208
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,832
- The man from the empty house.

209
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,082
He lives next door in there,

210
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,332
and he just goes out at night.

211
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,249
- Nobody lives in there, Ellen.

212
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,249
- Oh, yes he does.

213
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:15,707
Truly he does.

214
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,999
He comes into our house, too.

215
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:21,082
Barney's seen him, and
he hasn't got a face.

216
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,291
- [Liz] Well, that's silly, Ellen.

217
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,707
Barney was just telling you
a story to frighten you.

218
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,082
- I never did!

219
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,291
- Oh, what a fib.

220
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,957
He did so, Miss Howard.

221
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:29,749
- [Barney] Did not.

222
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:30,666
- You did so.

223
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,957
You know what he told me?

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,791
- You shut up!

225
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,041
You just talk and talk.

00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,582

228
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,166
I'll put your hair up.

229
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,499

- Let it alone.

236
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,166
- What's the matter, Barney?

237
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,166
Won't you tell me?

238
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,416
- I want Maxine to come back.

239
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,916
I love her.

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,832
- That's all right.

241
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,666
There's no reason why you
shouldn't love Maxine,

242
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,582
but can't we be friends too?

243
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,207
- Why did you come here?

244
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,457
We don't want you here.

245
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,041
You're my enemy.

246
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:30,999

252
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,499
- [Charles] Yes, yes.

253
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,166
Yeah, I know, yes.

254
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,166
- [Liz] Oh, excuse me.

255
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,957
- Oh, please don't go.

256
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:16,957
But I saw her two hours ago.

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,541
What's the matter with her now?

258
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:20,541
I see.

259
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,249
Well, hold on a minute, will you?

260
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,457
You're looking for David?

261
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,499
- [Liz] Yes.

262
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:26,291
- I thought the house looked

263
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:27,541
a little brighter this evening.

264
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,666
You're the new governess?

265
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,791
- Yes.

266
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,874
- Well, Dave is in the living room

267
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,457
with a creature named Goodwin.

268
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,332
- Well, if Mr. Fielding has company, I'll-

269
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,291
- Oh, I'd hardly call Goodwin company.

270
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:38,291
He's one of the local pests.

271
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,291
Oh, you go on, I'll join you.

272
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,457
Huh?

273
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:42,332
Yeah, well you better phone her

274
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,749
and tell her I'll drop round
about 9:30 to put her to bed.

275
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,499
- Besides this other
place being more modern

276
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,332
and easier on servants.

277
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,291
Not near the shipyard too.

278
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,832
- [David] Oh, come in.

279
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,082
This is Mr. Goodwin, Miss Howard.

280
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:53,999
- How do?

281
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,624
- [David] Sit down, won't you?
I'll be through in just a moment.

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,791
Look, it takes me exactly 10
minutes to get to the shipyard.

283
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:04,999
- You understand, Mr. Fielding,

284
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,041
I'm just looking out for your interests.

285
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,541
If you'd listened to me,
you would've gotten rid

286
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,166
of this house long ago.

287
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,041
It's gloomy, it's damp.

288
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:11,916
It's old fashioned.

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,791
- It's full of cockroaches,

290
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,041
the roof's falling in and
the plumbing's coming apart.

291
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,416
- This is a private conversation

292
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,666
if you don't mind, Dr. Evans.

293
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,499
- Why wouldn't I mind?

294
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,207
I was asked here for a game of cribbage.

295
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,249
- You understand, Mr. Fielding,

296
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,499
it's of no consequence to
me one way or the other.

297
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:24,916
- Except for your commission.

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,957
- Just a minute now, Dr. Evans.

299
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:29,749
In the whole 15 years I've
been in business in this town,

300
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,999
have I ever let a commission
get between me and a client?

301
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:32,832
- I wouldn't know.

302
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,041
I haven't been watching you.

303
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,457
- Night all.

304
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,916
- [David] Goodnight, Goodwin.

305
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,457
- You're pretty.

306
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,791
The last one was pretty, too.

307
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,207
- Subtle little fellow, isn't he?

308
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,916
What's he up to this time?

309
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,791
- You heard him.

310
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,041
Would you care for a drink, Miss Howard?

311
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:56,541
- Thank you, I don't drink.

312
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,249
- Well, you don't have
to make a virtue of it.

313
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,041
- Well, why not?

314
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,541
It's a refreshing touch around here.

315
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,749
- Is it?

316
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,082
Oh, you two haven't met?

317
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,166
- [Liz] Yes, we have.

318
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,957
- In the library, quite
casually, but very pleasantly.

319
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,832
- How'd you make out with
the children, Miss Howard?

320
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:12,957
Everything all right?

321
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:13,999
- I think so.

322
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,207
Ellen and I read all
about the Cowardly Lion

323
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,749
and I put her hair in curlers.

324
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,749
- How 'bout Barney?

325
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,541
- Barney and I had a talk, too.

326
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,249
- You mean you had a talk?

327
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,166
Let's have it, Miss Howard.

328
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,791
What do you really think about Barney?

329
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,249
- He seems very intelligent.

330
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,707
- He is very intelligent.

331
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,582
- He's also tricky and overemotional.

332
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,457
If you cross him,

333
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,249
he'll find a way to pay you back double.

334
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,916
On top of that, he has a vile temper

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,582
and he's an unprincipled little liar.

336
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,957
- You make him sound
like a little monster.

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,499
- Do I?

338
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,832
I thought I made him sound like my son.

339
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:43,999
- Miss Howard has hardly been here long

340
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,457
enough to see the resemblance.

341
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,041
Don't believe a word he says.

342
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,291
- Oh, I don't.

343
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:49,999
Just seems so unfair.

344
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:50,791
- Does it?

345
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,582
You have time for another
game of cribbage, Charles?

346
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,957
- No, I'm afraid that I
must be getting along.

347
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:54,749
- Where too?

348
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,582
- To the hospital.

349
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,082
I have to look in on Mrs. Dexter.

350
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:57,957
- Oh, good.

351
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:58,791
You can give me a lift.

352
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,707
I'm going that way.

353
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,999
You're not the nervous sort I hope?

354
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,457
You'll be alone here a great deal.

355
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,541
- Mr. Fielding?

356
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,416
- Yes?

357
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,791
- I meant to give you this.

358
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,082
- Where'd you find it?

359
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,791
- The dressing table in my room.

360
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,207
- I see.

361
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:23,957
- Are you from Boston, Miss Howard?

362
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,207
- We lived in Sharon.

363
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,999
- Oh, well then you're
used to small towns.

364
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,207
You won't be too bored here.

365
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,499
- I'm sure I won't.

366
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,916
- Miss Howard, if you'd
like something to read,

367
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,041
you'll find it right in there.

368
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,207
Just to help yourself.

369
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:35,999
- Thank you.

370
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:36,832
- When I'm out at night,

371
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:37,999
this light is always left on.

372
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,791
I'll turn it off when I come home.

373
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,749
- [Charles] Goodnight, Miss Howard.

374
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,999
- [Liz] Night.

375
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,416
- Goodnight.

376
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,207
- [Liz] Goodnight, Mr. Fielding.

377
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,957
(pensive music)

378
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,249
- Well, what did you think of her?

379
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,749
- Well, for once in his
life, Goodwin was right.

380
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,041
She is pretty, very pretty.

381
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,166
- That's not what I meant.

382
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,999
- Still, it doesn't do any harm, does it?

383
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,749
(engine rumbling)
(music continues)

384
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:18,791
(doorbell rings)
(anticipatory music)

385
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,957
- [Marian] Oh, good evening.

386
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,749
I'm sorry to disturb you.

387
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,166
I wonder if I might choose
your telephone to call a cab?

388
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,499
I think it's going to rain again.

389
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,416
- Of course.

390
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,291
Come in.

391
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,291
It's in here.

392
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:41,957
- Oh, thank you.

393
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,749
There are no public
telephones anywhere near here.

394
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,041
- Shall I call it for you?

395
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:46,957
- Oh, please do.

396
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,916
- I'll do it, I promise I'll do it.

397
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,749
She's downstairs.

398
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,957
She came this afternoon,
but I'll do it honestly.

399
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,582
- [Maxine] Be sure now Barney or I'll-

400
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,832
- [Barney] Cross my heart and hope to die

401
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,166
in a cellar full of rats.

402
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,082
- [Maxine] You're a good boy, Barney.

403
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,041
- Who is that?

404
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:02,749
Hello?

405
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,207
Barney, who are you talking to?

406
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,582
Barney, who was that?

407
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,457
Will you excuse me a moment?

408
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,541
Perhaps you better call a taxi yourself.

409
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,916
- I've got to go now.

410
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,749
That was her.

411
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,082
She's coming. She heard us.

412
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,957
(dramatic music)

413
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,749
(music softens)

414
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,791
- Who was that on the phone, Barney?

415
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:36,791
- [Barney] Who?

416
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:37,707
- Barney, I heard you.

417
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,249
You were talking to somebody.

418
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,291
You said, "I'll do it."

419
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:42,791
What did she tell you to do?

420
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,249
- She told me to be a good boy.

421
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,916
- I don't believe that, Barney.

422
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,749
If you wanna use the phone again,

423
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:53,166
you're to ask my permission.

424
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,541
Do you understand?

425
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,749
- Yes, Miss Howard.

426
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,541
- And you shouldn't be reading.

427
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:58,582
You should be asleep.

428
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,249
- [Barney] Yes, Miss Howard.

429
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:02,916
(gentle music)

430
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,832
(pensive music)

431
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,582
- [Liz] Did you get your cab?

432
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,999
- Oh, I hope you don't
mind my coming in here.

433
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,541
I wanted to see the back garden,

434
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,457
but I'm afraid it's too dark.

435
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:42,541
- Our garden?

436
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,916
- No, my garden.

437
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,041
- But I thought that-

438
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,166
- I'm Marian Tygarth.

439
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,499
- Oh, that was your father's house?

440
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,791
- No, the Commodore was my husband.

441
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,499
- Oh, I thought of him-

442
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:56,249
- As an old man?

443
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,499
- Well, yes.

444
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,541
- He was, a mean old man.

445
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,291
He was the meanest man I've ever known.

446
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,291
When he was gone, I tried to feel sorry,

447
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,541
but he died abroad, you know?

448
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:15,207
Does David Fielding still live here?

449
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,207
- [Liz] Yes.

450
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:17,916
- Is he as handsome as ever?

451
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,749
- Yes, he's-

452
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,457
- He looks younger than I do, doesn't he?

453
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:22,832
- Yes.

454
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,457
- He is.

455
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,249
Are you his second wife?

456
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,249
- No, I'm not Mrs.
Fielding, I'm the governess.

457
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:33,291
- Then he didn't marry
again after the accident?

458
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:34,999
- No.

459
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,457
(bell rings)

460
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,999
That must be your cab.

461
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,999
- Do you like it here in New Bristol?

462
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,707
- I've only been here a few hours.

463
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,041
- Oh, you're lucky.

464
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,041
I was born here.

465
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,499
I was married here.

466
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:48,249
I came to that house next door as a bride.

467
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,166
I was just about your age.

468
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,207
Now it's all I have left in the world.

469
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,707
(bell rings)

470
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:58,416
- Anybody call a cab?

471
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,041
- Oh, yes I did.
- Okay, it's here.

472
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,166
- Oh, it is raining.

473
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,582
- I'll get an umbrella.

474
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,457
(rain pattering)

475
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,749
- Look at it, sealed up like a vault.

476
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,499
The day before we left,

477
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,749
my husband had Mr. Goodwin's
men boarded up so tight

478
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,207
not even a ray of light to get into it.

479
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,499
Mr. Goodwin was the
commodore's agent, you know?

480
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,082
- [Liz] Yes, I've met Mr. Goodwin.

481
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,166
- Ladies, I'm not getting
any drier standing here.

482
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,207
- Oh, I'm coming.

483
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,041
Well, goodbye.

484
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,416
You've been very nice to me.

485
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,749
I hope to see more of you.

486
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:37,416
(door closes)

487
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,249
(pensive music)

488
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:50,207
(dog barking)
(anticipatory music)

489
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,541
- [Ellen] Miss Howard?

490
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,457
- Yes?

491
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,332
Yes, Ellen?

492
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,541
Still awake, dear?

493
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,832
- Do you always leave the door open

494
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,541
in between our rooms at night?

495
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:18,499
- If you want.

496
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,291
It's time for little girls to be asleep.

497
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,999
- Miss Howard, what did they call you

498
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,749
when you were a little girl?

499
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,999
- I'm afraid they called me Liz.

500
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:29,041
- May I call you Miss Liz?

501
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,499
- Of course you may,
beginning tomorrow morning.

502
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,582
Would you like Dumbo to sleep with you?

503
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,707
- Barney's got him.

504
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,749
- I'll get him for you.

505
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:42,249
(water splashing)
(intriguing music)

506
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:43,957
Is Barney taking a bath?

507
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:46,582
- Oh no, he leaves the
water running to keep awake.

508
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,041
You see, he's not allowed to go to sleep.

509
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,166
Oh, please don't say I told you, Miss Liz.

510
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,249
(gentle music)
(water splashing)

511
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,916
(splashing stops)

512
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,749
(dramatic music)

513
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,916
(gentle music)

514
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,082
(anticipatory music)

515
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,541
- Here's Dumbo, and I'll
leave the door open.

516
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,249
Now, go to sleep.

517
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,957
- Goodnight, Miss Liz.

518
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:55,082
(anticipatory music)

519
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:01,082
- [Barney] Gimme that.

520
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,041
I told you I needed him.

521
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,249
- [Ellen] Barney!

522
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:07,207
(music continues)

523
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,041
(water splashing)

524
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:31,541
(bright piano music playing)

525
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:53,832
(off note key chimes)

526
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,999
- (sighs) No dear, it's
G natural, not G sharp.

527
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:57,916
Try it again.

528
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:02,749
(playing continues)

529
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:03,957
- Bravo.
(Charles applauding)

530
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,666
And when did we give our first concert?

531
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,749
- [Liz] Soon now.

532
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:07,666
- Good afternoon.

533
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,791
And how is Miss Fielding today?

534
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:09,791
Cough better?

535
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:10,999
- It's entirely gone.

536
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:11,832
Thank you, Doctor.

537
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,041
- [Charles] That's very gratifying.

538
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,749
- Wanna listen to my chest?

539
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:16,541
- What would that get me?

540
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:17,499
- Ah!

541
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,874
- Oh, go on beat it.
You're as strong as a horse.

542
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,541
- A horse?
(Barney imitates horse braying)

543
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,791
- Stop that Barney and
go put your coat on.

544
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,749
Aren't you going to
finish your piece, dear?

545
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:26,749
- Yes, Miss Liz.

546
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,791
(bright piano music playing)

547
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,541
- I see you've made someone
in this house happy already.

548
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,249
I only hope you can do
as well for the others.

549
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:37,041
- Thank you.

550
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,666
- I hope you'll be happy here yourself.

551
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,916
- I'm sure I will.

552
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,249
- They need someone like you.

553
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,457
David isn't the easiest person

554
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,457
in the world to get along with.

555
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,041
And since his wife was killed-

556
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:49,291
(playing stops)

557
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,332
- I finished, Miss Liz.

558
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,207
- All right, dear.

559
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,082
Get your things on.

560
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:55,957
- That was two years ago.

561
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,082
He's never really got over it,

562
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,541
but are days when he's the
most charming man I know.

563
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,999
And other days he's not quite so charming.

564
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,416
And since you're going to be in the house,

565
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,666
you are to be the victim.

566
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,166
- [David] The victim of what, Charles?

567
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,832
- I wish you wouldn't
creep up on people, David,

568
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,249
especially when they're talking about you.

569
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:10,041
Here.

570
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:10,999
Here are your sleeping pills.

571
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,957
If these don't work,
I'll buy you a hammer.

572
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,041
- Come on, Chip,
(Chip barks)

573
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:14,916
we're going out.

574
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,832
- Wait for me!

575
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,416
- I can run faster than
anybody in the world.

576
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,791
I can run faster than you can.

577
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,666
- No, you can't!

578
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,666
- Where are the children going?

579
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,916
- I'm taking them for a walk.

580
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,207
- How 'bout a game this evening?

581
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,999
- I'm dining out.

582
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,291
If I get home early, I'll call you.

583
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,499
- [Ellen] "Slayer's still at large."

584
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,332
- Ellen!

585
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,749
- "No clues say police in brutal murder."

586
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,749
- Give that to me.

587
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,916
- I'm afraid this is
one of those other days.

588
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:49,416
Have a good time.

589
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,416
♪ Step on a crack ♪

590
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,749

00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,749
He did, Miss Liz.
- Sneak!

596
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,541
- He's just impossible.
- Hello.

597
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:05,832
- Well, well, the whole family.

598
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,707
Good afternoon.

599
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,666
- Come on, Chip.

600
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,041
- Out seeing our little town?

601
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,249
- Yes, the children are showing me around.

602
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:12,457
- Not very much to see, I'm afraid.

603
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:13,291
Not at first.

604
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,082
You have to have lived here.

605
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,207
You have to know things about people.

606
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,916
- I'm not very inquisitive, Mr. Goodwin.

607
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,957
- Aren't you?

608
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:19,332
I am. In my business, I have to be.

609
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:20,457
- Barney, wait for me!

610
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,332
- Now, take that young lady I
mentioned to you last night.

611
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:23,082
- Barney!

612
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:24,582
- She was pretty all right, but
I could see she was trouble.

613
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,541
- Excuse me, Mr. Goodwin.

614
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,749
- Don't walk too far.

615
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:31,041
- Look, Mounties.

616
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:31,832
Can we go?

617
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:32,999
Can we see the movie?

618
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,791
- I don't know, it's after four.

619
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,166
- [Ellen] Oh, please Miss Liz.

620
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,499
Let's see the movie.

621
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,916
- I didn't bring any money.

622
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,207
- Barney's got money.

623
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,707
- [Liz] Not that much.

624
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,957
- I have too, look.

625
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,832
- That is a lot of money.

626
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,249
Did you open your bank?

627
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:49,207
- No.
- It's his wages.

628
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,082
- Wages?

629
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,791
Barney, where did you get so much money?

630
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:53,791
- [Barney] Oh, I had it.

631
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,332
(Ellen gasps)

632
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,291
Three, please.

633
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,666
- I'll give it back to you,
Barney, when we get home.

634
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,582
- Sonny, you can take that dog in there.

635
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,041
Leave him with the usher as you go in.

636
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,332
- [Barney] Oh, gee.

637
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:12,291
(bell dings)

638
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,499
(horn honking)

639
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:22,416
("Popeye" theme song playing)

640
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,207
- Where's Barney?

641
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,249
- [Ellen] He went out.

642
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:34,707
- When?

643
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:37,041
- [Ellen] He's probably calling her again.

644
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,041
- Come on, Ellen.

645
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:39,749
- [Ellen] Oh, please, Miss Liz.

646
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,791
- Shh, shh!
- Come along.

647
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:44,041
- Yes, I do.

648
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,916
Tell me again, quick.

649
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,749
I'll do it.

650
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,041
Cross my heart, I'll do my best.

651
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,666
I did tell her to go away.

652
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,041
Please, please, I've got to go now.

653
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:54,041
She's coming.

654
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:58,332
Hello.

655
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,499
- What did I tell you about
telephone calls, Barney?

656
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:01,957
- I wasn't calling anybody.

657
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,749
- You were too, and I know who.

658
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:04,791
- You shut your big mouth.

659
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:05,832
Come on, Chip.

660
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:09,707
- We'll have to hurry.

661
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,707
It's getting late.

662
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:18,082
(pensive music)

663
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,332
Barney, I thought you
said you knew the way?

664
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,666
Barney, it's so late and
we're nowhere near home.

665
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,499
- Yes, we are.

666
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:30,416
This is a shortcut.

667
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,749
- Barney, you're sure?

668
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:32,541
- Right down here.

669
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,999
It comes out near the house.

670
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:35,832
- Oh, Miss Liz, he's-

671
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,332
- Yes, Ellen, what were you saying?

672
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,082
- Nothing, Miss Liz.

673
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,957
(dramatic music)

674
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:51,707
It's dark and I'm scared.
- Shh, darling.

675
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,207
There's nothing to be afraid of.

676
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,541
- There is too, Miss Liz.

677
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,249
He's up to something, I know he is.

678
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:58,749
- Barney, where are we?

679
00:29:58,792 --> 00:29:59,999
What is this street?

680
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,541
- We're in Salem Alley.

681
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:03,749
- Salem Alley?

682
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:06,749
Barney, come back here.

683
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:08,249
There's nothing to be afraid of.

684
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,999
You brought us here and
we're going through.

685
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:10,999
Come on, children.

686
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,457
(eerie music)

687
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:18,541
- It's him, he's out for us!

688
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,416
(dramatic music)

689
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,791
(music softens)

690
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,041
Open the door, let us in.

691
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:33,041
Hurry, hurry! Quick!
(Ellen speaking indistinctly)

692
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,541
(fists banging)

693
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,416
- Close the door, Dad,

694
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,749
close the door!
- Faster, faster!

695
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:37,582
- What happened?

696
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,791
The children are scared to death.

697
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,499
- We were walking through Salem Alley.

698
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:42,332
- Salem Alley?

699
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,207
What for?

700
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:44,041
- [Liz] To get home.

701
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,082
- But it's clear outta your way.

702
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:45,999
- [Liz] But I didn't know that.

703
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,582
- Well, you know what
happened there, don't you?

704
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,291
- A woman was murdered.

705
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:51,666
- Is that a place to take children?

706
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,207
- I didn't take them, they took me.

707
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,166
- [David] I see.

708
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,916
- Mr. Fielding?
- Yes?

709
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,582
- I'm trying to do my best for them,

710
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,082
but you have to help me.

711
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:00,957
- [David] How?

712
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,082
- How much pocket money
do you give Barney?

713
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,291
- A quarter a week if he
brushes his teeth regularly,

714
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,916
and he lives right up to his income.

715
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,166
- Quarter a week?

716
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,749
- Perhaps you don't think that's enough?

717
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,249
- Of course, only-
- Only what?

718
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,791
- Why did you discharge Maxine?

719
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,499
- She was a bad influence on the children

720
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,416
and she took too much interest
in my private affairs.

721
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,457
Satisfied?

722
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:21,749
- Barney still telephones her.

723
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:22,916
- [David] Why don't you stop him?

724
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,707
- I told him not to do it again.

725
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:26,332
- Well, see that he obeys you.

726
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:30,041
And from now on, suppose you
keep your mind on the children

727
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:32,249
and off things that don't concern you.

728
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:34,582
Goodnight.

729
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,166
I said Goodnight, Miss Howard.

730
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:58,166
(anticipatory music)
(engine rumbling)

731
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,582
(door opens)

732
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:06,541
- Mr. Fielding?

733
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,332
Mr. Fielding?

734
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:12,332
(mysterious music)

735
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,332
(music continues)

736
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:45,582
(footsteps scuffling)

737
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,499
(suspenseful music)

738
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,707
- [Chester] You got beer?

739
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,291
- Beer?

740
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,332
(flashlight clicks)

741
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,207
- [Chester] The other one gave me beer.

742
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,457
- Who are you?

743
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,332
- Smoke?

744
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:19,957
I'm Chester.

745
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,999
- Were you...

746
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,249
Are you the man I saw in
the garden last night?

747
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,541
- [Charles] Sure.

748
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,166
I'm here every night.

749
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,207
I fix the furnace.

750
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,249
- Oh.

751
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,541
- And I fix it good.

752
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,999
You tell that cook if she
leaves the damper open again,

753
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,749
I'll get mad.

754
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:38,416
I'll break something.

755
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,166
Hm?

756
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:42,957
You tell her?

757
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,582
- Yes, I'll tell her.

758
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,499
- [Charles] What are you scared for?

759
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,749
I'm a nice guy.

760
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:51,957
(Chester spits)

761
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:53,082
Ask Maxine.

762
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:55,041
She knows.

763
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,582
Next time beer, hm?

764
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,749
(soft music)

765
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,332
(door closes)

766
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,457
(music stops abruptly)

767
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:25,249
(pensive music)

768
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,957
(objects crashing)

769
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:52,832
(music continues)

770
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,749
(music continues)

771
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,207
(stone thuds)

772
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:35,416
(light music)

773
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,499
- [Liz] Mr. Fielding,
would you like some...

774
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:04,457
(music continues)

775
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,582
Oh!

776
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,166
- What's the matter?

777
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,499
- You startled me.

778
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,041
I didn't expect to see you.

779
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,332
- I live here, remember?

780
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:22,582
- Why yes, but-
(David sniffing)

781
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:23,582
- Coffee.

782
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,207
Who's the second cup for?

783
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,041
- For you.

784
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,832
- Great, I'm starved.

785
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,582
We had squab for dinner, wharf squab.

786
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:34,707
And some awful dessert
with lemon jelly in it.

787
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,082
- I thought you'd gone upstairs.

788
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,832
- Expect me to go to
bed with the children?

789
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,249
- Of course not, but...

790
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,332
(sighs) That's not the way to carve.

791
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,582
- Yeah, well, it's this knife.

792
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:47,832
- Are you sure it's the knife?

793
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,041
- You try it.

794
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,666
Oh, well, you carve it on the side.

795
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,582
- You think that's unfair (chuckles)?

796
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:59,541
- I wasn't very civil
to you this afternoon.

797
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,791
- [Liz] No, you weren't.

798
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:01,749
- Sorry.

799
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:03,707
- Well, I don't blame you.

800
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:05,457
I must seemed a little silly rushing in

801
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,207
that way after the children.

802
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,707
- Well, I didn't have to growl at you.

803
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,499
- [Liz] Why not if you felt like growling?

804
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:12,999
- Dr. Evans was right.

805
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,541
This house does need somebody like you.

806
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,207
Needs you very much.

807
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:17,207
- Thank you.

808
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:18,832
- You know, I almost sent you

809
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,249
back to Boston yesterday.

810
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:22,041
- Why didn't you?

811
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:25,082
- Well, I guess I liked
the way you talked.

812
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,832
It sounded like the truth.

813
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,916
- You mean because I told you I was fired?

814
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,749
- Mm hm.

815
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,499
And the way you spoke up
for Barney last night.

816
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:32,582
I like that too.

817
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:38,041
I like your smile, the way
your hair falls outta place.

818
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,999
I even like the way you carve.

819
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:48,041
(swelling orchestral music)

820
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:58,582
What have I done now?

821
00:37:58,708 --> 00:37:59,457
- Oh, nothing.

822
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,457
I just wondered why you
had your overcoat on.

823
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,791
- Well, it's cold outside.

824
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,291
How's the coffee coming?

825
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,207
- I'll see.

826
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:19,916
It's gone.

827
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,041
- What's gone?

828
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,791
- [Liz] It was here under this.

829
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,499
- What was where under what?

830
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:27,082
- A 50 cent piece under the shaker.

831
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,332
I thought it was left for
the milkman or somebody.

832
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:30,207
- Well, don't look at me.

833
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:31,207
I didn't take it.

834
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:34,041
- But it was here just before
I went down to the cellar.

835
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,332
- What were you doing in the cellar?

836
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,999
- I heard a noise.

837
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:41,207
- What sort of a noise?

838
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,541
- I'm trying to tell you.

839
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:46,999
I heard something so I made
myself go down and look.

840
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:48,499
Then when I saw what it was-

841
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,332
- Is there any reason
why you shouldn't tell me

842
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,832
what you're talking about?

843
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,832
- I'll show you what I'm talking about.

844
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,041
It's not there anymore.

845
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,999
The coal was all over the floor.

846
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:18,832
That was the noise I heard,
one of the sacks falling.

847
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:19,916
- Chester cleaned it up.

848
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,541
- Chester had already gone.

849
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:22,999
- He must have come back.

850
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:23,916
- He couldn't.

851
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,291
I'd have seen him come in.

852
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,749
- [David] You didn't
see me come in, did you?

853
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:30,541
- I heard you in the front hall.

854
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,832
I called down to you.

855
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:33,207
- But I came in through the garage.

856
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:34,457
I wasn't even near the front hall.

857
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,291
- Then who put out the light?

858
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,666
- Perhaps I forgot to turn it on it.

859
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,541
- It was on when you left, I saw it.

860
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,749
- Maybe the bulb went out.

861
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,999
- Mr. Fielding, I heard
someone come in the front way.

862
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:44,999
- [David] You seem to have
heard a lot of things tonight.

863
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:46,666
- I haven't heard anything
that wasn't there.

864
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,541
I tell you, someone's been
in this house tonight.

865
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,041
- Do you have these
hallucinations often, Miss Howard?

866
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,082
- [Liz] Will you stop treating
me like a mental case?

867
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:54,832
- Then stop acting like one.

868
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:55,916
- Why won't you believe me?

869
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,957
I'm telling you the truth.

870
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:57,957
I'm frightened.

871
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,749
- I think you'd better
stop talking nonsense

872
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,249
and pull yourself together.

873
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,291
- I see.

874
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,457
Very well, goodnight.

875
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,957
I said goodnight, Mr. Fielding.

876
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:41,291
(train rattling)

877
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:45,791
(Barney imitates train horn blaring)

878
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:57,791
- Now look what you've done!

879
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,541
You've wrecked my train.

880
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:00,916
(Barney imitates train horn blaring)

881
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,832
You're a nasty, destructive little boy.

882
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:04,749
- Ellen!

883
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:06,499
- He is, Miss Liz.

884
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:09,166
He's killed all my passengers.

885
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,249
- I wanna talk to you.

886
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,041
- Yes, Miss Liz?

887
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:15,499
- Ellen, what was the name of
the woman in your scrapbook?

888
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,582
- Snow White.

889
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,249
- Not Snow White, dear.

890
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,207
The other one.

891
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,541
- I don't know, Miss Liz.

892
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:29,832
- [Liz] Ellen, bring me
your scrapbook, please.

893
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,291
- Here it is, Miss Liz.

894
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,207
- Thank you.

895
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:56,416
(Barney imitates train horn blaring)

896
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,957
Where is the picture of Salem Alley?

897
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,999
You've torn it out.

898
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,249
(Barney imitates train horn blaring)

899
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:03,916
Barney, be quiet and stop that train.

900
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,957
Ellen, what was the name of
the woman in that picture?

901
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,041
And don't pretend you don't know.

902
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:10,957
- Her name was-
- She doesn't know her name.

903
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,916
- [Liz] Yes, she does.

904
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,041
So do you, Barney.

905
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,041
- I don't either.

906
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,416
- Ellen, you told me her name was Alberta.

907
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,249
- [Barney] She made it up.

908
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:19,541
She's always making things up.

909
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,207
- Barney, I'm talking to Ellen.

910
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:24,749
Ellen, you didn't make it up, did you?

911
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:31,249
- Yes, I did, Miss Liz.

912
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,791
I made it all up out of my own head.

913
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:37,166
- Go to your room,
Ellen, and shut the door.

914
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,499
I'm very angry with you both.

915
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:44,082
You're not to talk to each
other nor play together.

916
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:46,999
- Miss Liz?

917
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,207
- [Liz] Yes?

918
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:50,166
- Aren't we friends anymore?

919
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,249
- [Liz] Not until you tell me the truth.

920
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:56,999
(door closes)

921
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:59,082
- She did make it up.

922
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:00,041
- Did she?

923
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:21,041
♪ Nobody wants you to know ♪

924
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:26,041
♪ There'll be some changes made today ♪

925
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:28,999
♪ There'll be some changes made ♪

926
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:30,291
Oh, Mrs. Norris?

927
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:31,166
- You want me?

928
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,999
- Would you keep an eye on the children?
- Yes.

929
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,499
- I'm going over to talk to the doctor.

930
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,082
The number's 23, isn't it?

931
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,832
- Across the crescent,
first house on the left.

932
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:38,749
Be gone long?

933
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:39,666
- Just a few minutes.

934
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,499
- I hope so.

935
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:41,749
I don't reckon to be here after dark.

936
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:43,291
Not the way things are.

937
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,457
- What do you mean, Mrs. Norris?

938
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:45,791
- You ought to know.

939
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,707
Just get back before dark, that's all.

940
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,582
- Oh, I will.

941
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:53,832
- You must remember that David's children

942
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:56,041
have been left to
themselves more than most.

943
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,791
It was an unhappy marriage
and had a tragic ending.

944
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:02,082
Since then, they've seen much
too little of their father.

945
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:06,166
Now, next door to them is this
huge empty, shuttered house.

946
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,249
Do you wonder that it fascinates them?

947
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,416
That they make it the setting
for whatever play story

948
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,999
they happen to be acting
out at the moment?

949
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:14,249
- They weren't acting
yesterday in Salem Alley.

950
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,582
They were terrified,

951
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:17,416
and those telephone
calls were real enough,

952
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,749
and that murder's real.

953
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:21,749
- Yes, it is.

954
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,541
- [Liz] And they knew that
dead woman's name two days

955
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:25,541
before it was in the paper.

956
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:27,499
Can you explain that?

957
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:29,332
- No, I'm afraid I can't.

958
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,666
What does David think?

959
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,249
I suppose you told him.

960
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:34,749
- I tried to tell him what
happened last night, but-

961
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:36,791
- He wasn't very helpful, eh?

962
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:37,791
Would you like me to talk to him?

963
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:39,666
- No, please don't.

964
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,166
I'd much rather you didn't.

965
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,374
- Oh, come now.
David is not that unreasonable.

966
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,791
(Miss Budge knocks)

967
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,332
Yeah?

968
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:48,082
- Excuse me, Doctor.
- Yes, Miss Budge?

969
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,499
- Miss Gardner is still waiting

970
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:51,541
and Mr. Ellis has an appointment for 4:30.

971
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,457
- [Charles] Thank you.

972
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:54,666
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have kept you so long.

973
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,707
- That's quite all right.

974
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,957
- I think I've told you all there is.

975
00:44:58,042 --> 00:44:59,749
- I'm afraid I haven't been very helpful.

976
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,499
- You've been very kind.

977
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:04,082
I don't think even you
realise how worried I am.

978
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:06,416
Last night I almost thought
of calling the police.

979
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,499
- The police?

980
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:09,416
I hope you didn't mention that to David.

981
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,249
- No.
- In your place,

982
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,666
it's the last thing I'd do,

983
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,832
before consulting David that is.

984
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:14,457
- Oh, I wouldn't really.

985
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,249
It's just that I, I
didn't know where to turn.

986
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,999
- I know we all feel that way at times.

987
00:45:20,042 --> 00:45:22,166
If it happens again, I wish you'd call me.

988
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:26,791
Miss Budge, if Miss Howard
phones when I'm not here

989
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,707
I want you to get in
touch with me immediately.

990
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,541
- Yes, Doctor.

991
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:30,416
- Goodbye, Miss Howard.

992
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,249
- Thank you, Doctor.

993
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:32,166
Goodbye.

994
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:34,791
- Can't figure why you'd be

995
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:36,207
gettin' sentimental all of a sudden.

996
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,582
- But can't they put it
off just for a few days?

997
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:39,457
- I think they wouldn't.

998
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,582
I wouldn't care to ask him.

999
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,832
(light music playing)

1000
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,041
- Oh, Miss Howard?

1001
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:54,957
Good afternoon.

1002
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:55,957
- Well, how do you do?

1003
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:57,082
- You are not ill, I hope?

1004
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:57,957
- No.

1005
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,457
- I just wondered seeing you
come out from the doctors.

1006
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:03,082
How's David?

1007
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:05,332
- Mr. Fielding's quite well, thank you.

1008
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,041
- You might tell him I'm
a little annoyed with him

1009
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,499
for not coming to see me.

1010
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:10,791
We used to be such good friends, you know?

1011
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:14,416
(light music playing)

1012
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,957
Mr. Goodwin is handling
the opening of my house.

1013
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,957
- You're opening it?

1014
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,041
- I have to.

1015
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:20,999
That's why I came back from abroad.

1016
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:23,749
I hate that tune.

1017
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:24,541
Stop playing that.

1018
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:25,957
Please stop it at once.

1019
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,832
Here.

1020
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,041
Go and play somewhere else.

1021
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:30,957
- Thank you.

1022
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,957
- I just can't bear that tune.

1023
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,957
Somebody was playing it,

1024
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,499
I heard it coming across the garden

1025
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:39,082
the night the Commodore died.

1026
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,291
- Well, goodbye, Mrs. Tygarth.

1027
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,166
- Oh, there you are.

1028
00:46:55,792 --> 00:46:57,749
I thought you were never coming.

1029
00:46:57,792 --> 00:46:59,166
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Norris.

1030
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,457
- Well, it's happened.

1031
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:02,291
- What's happened?
- She's gone.

1032
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,416
- What are you talking about?

1033
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,041
- That Lily? I just looked in her room.

1034
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:06,291
- But this is her day off.

1035
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:07,416
- Her day off, is it?

1036
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,082
She's moved out back in baggage.

1037
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:10,207
- You mean she isn't coming back?

1038
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:11,166
- What do you think I mean?

1039
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,999
What's more unless you get
somebody to take her place,

1040
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,332
I'm not coming back either.

1041
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,041
- But Mrs. Norris, you can't do that.

1042
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,957
You can't leave me all
alone in this house.

1043
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:18,749
- Can't I?

1044
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,416
If you had any sense, you'd go too.

1045
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,416
- And leave the children?

1046
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,707
- That's your business.

1047
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:23,957
Seen this?

1048
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:25,166
- Yes, I've seen it.

1049
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,541
- A day worker like me lying all alone

1050
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:29,916
in the gutter with a broken neck.

1051
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,416
- Mrs. Norris, please come back.

1052
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,457
- I'll come back when
you get a maid, maybe.

1053
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:35,332
- I'll call the agency the
first thing in the morning.

1054
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:36,791
- You'd better.

1055
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:39,541
(pensive music)

1056
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:47,749
(light music)

1057
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:55,957
- Miss Liz?

1058
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,832
Miss Liz?

1059
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:01,249
Please don't be mad anymore.

1060
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:09,082
- I'm not mad at you, Ellen,

1061
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:12,207
but I can't talk to you
until you tell me the truth.

1062
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,916
- I'll tell you, Miss Liz.

1063
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,957
I'll tell you how I knew her name.

1064
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,499
It was in the watch.

1065
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:18,332
- In the watch?

1066
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,457
- Mm hm.

1067
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:21,457
Barney found it outside on the steps

1068
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:23,541
after the woman ran away.

1069
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,249
He hid it in that drawer there.

1070
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,457
- Come on, dear.

1071
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,041
You must go back to bed.

1072
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:35,249
- Can't I stay here with you, Miss Liz?

1073
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,041
- Hm mm.

1074
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:37,582
- Aren't we friends again?

1075
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:39,291
- Yes, of course we're friends.

1076
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,999
Now you have to be a good
girl and go to sleep.

1077
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:45,332
It's very late.

1078
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:46,999
- [Ellen] I'm not tired.

1079
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:49,249
- You'll go to sleep all right.

1080
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:52,416
Barney's in there sleeping
like a little door mouse.

1081
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,999
- Barney doesn't have
to stay awake tonight.

1082
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,541
He's earned his wages.

1083
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:01,832
- Ellen, Ellen, how does
Barney earn his wages?

1084
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:03,207
- He opens the front door

1085
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:06,207
so the man from the
empty house can come in.

1086
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,332
Maxine tells him when.

1087
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:11,707
After he's opened the door,
he puts Dumbo in the window.

1088
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:15,749
- All right, dear.

1089
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:20,791
Now let's forget all about that
for tonight and go to sleep.

1090
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,457
(suspenseful music)

1091
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,582
(anticipatory music)

1092
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:46,207
(music intensifies)

1093
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:56,332
(dramatic music)

1094
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:01,041
(Liz gasping)

1095
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:04,541
(footsteps approaching)

1096
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,499
(doorknob rattling)

1097
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,416
(unsettling music)

1098
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:52,207
(anticipatory music)

1099
00:50:58,042 --> 00:51:00,791
(dial spinning)

1100
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,041
- Hello?

1101
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:05,999
Miss Howard?

1102
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,999
Yes, he just got back from the hospital.

1103
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,791
- Would you ask him to come over?

1104
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,749
It's very important.

1105
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:13,666
Thank you.

1106
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:17,291
(dramatic music)

1107
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,791
- Did you find what you were looking for?

1108
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:41,541
I see you did find it.

1109
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,957
- It has her name in it.
- Really?

1110
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:43,957
- The woman who was murdered.

1111
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,499
- You're quite a detective, aren't you?

1112
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:47,416
- Barney found it outside this house.

1113
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,249
- [David] I don't like people
prying into my affairs.

1114
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,207
I told you that.

1115
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,541
- He found it the night she was killed.

1116
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:53,999
- And I won't have you
or anyone else going through my desk.

1117
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:55,707
I thought I made that clear, too.

1118
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,082
Now, give it to me.

1119
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,249
I said give it to me.

1120
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:03,082
(doorbell ringing)

1121
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:08,582
- Hello.

1122
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,999
- What are you doing here?

1123
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:14,499
- You all right, Miss Howard?

1124
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:15,832
- What makes you think she isn't?

1125
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:17,832
- Well, when a doctor gets called
in the middle of the night,

1126
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:20,457
he usually assumes that
something is not all right.

1127
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:22,457
You did call, didn't you?

1128
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,916
- If she did, she seems
to have forgotten why.

1129
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,499
- What is this, a game?

1130
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:28,541
- Perhaps Miss Howard was
nervous in the house alone

1131
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,291
and wanted someone to talk to,

1132
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:31,707
or maybe she had something to show you.

1133
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:32,749
Was that it?

1134
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:33,666
- No.

1135
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,207
- While I was out, she made a discovery,

1136
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,499
didn't you, Miss Howard?

1137
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:40,541
You wouldn't want the doctor
to make a trip for nothing.

1138
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:41,916
Show him what you found.

1139
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:43,541
- What is it, Miss Howard?

1140
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:45,041
You did send for me, you know?

1141
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:46,957
- [David] Go on, show it to him.

1142
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,166
- Leave me alone, both of you.

1143
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,416
- Jumpy, isn't she?

1144
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,457
What would you suggest?

1145
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,916
- Don't be a fool, David.

1146
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,749
Now, if either one of you

1147
00:52:53,792 --> 00:52:55,041
has another brainstorm before morning,

1148
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,041
please leave me out of it.

1149
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:56,957
Goodnight.

1150
00:52:58,292 --> 00:53:03,041
- Well, you called him and he came.

1151
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:04,041
You satisfied?

1152
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,457
Can't you say anything at all?

1153
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,457
- I haven't anything to say,

1154
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,082
except I'm sorry I opened your desk.

1155
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,249
Here's your watch.

1156
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,207
And why did you pretend not to
believe me last night

1157
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:20,166
when I told you somebody
had come into this house?

1158
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,499
- Do you think I was pretending?

1159
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:23,041
- You said you hadn't
been near the front hall,

1160
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,041
I don't believe that.

1161
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,499
And the door was open again tonight

1162
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:26,707
and I know now who opened it.

1163
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:27,541
Barney did.

1164
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:30,082
- So you think my little boy's
letting me into my own house?

1165
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,666
- He doesn't know who he's letting in.

1166
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,791
- But you do?

1167
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:35,707
Is that what you were thinking
when Charles was here?

1168
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:37,832
Is that why you didn't show him the watch?

1169
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:40,291
Answer me.

1170
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,332
- You know why.

1171
00:53:42,792 --> 00:53:45,582
- Elizabeth-
- Leave me alone, can't you?

1172
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:49,332
(swelling orchestral music)

1173
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:56,791
- So this is what it was all about.

1174
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:58,499
- That name mean anything to you?

1175
00:53:58,542 --> 00:53:59,457
- Oh yes, David.

1176
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:00,416
I read the papers.

1177
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,041
- Barney found it.
- Where?

1178
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:04,499
- In front of the house.
What am I gonna do with it?

1179
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,916
- Only one thing you can do with it.

1180
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,582
Take it to the police.

1181
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,082
- No, I won't do that.

1182
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:13,749
- [Charles] You'll have to, David.

1183
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:14,999
They're going to find out.

1184
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:16,499
- Not unless someone tells them.

1185
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:18,207
- Somebody always does tell them.

1186
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,041
- She's dead, isn't she?

1187
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:20,457
She doesn't need her watch anymore.

1188
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,416
I don't want them swarming

1189
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,791
over the place questioning
everyone, even the children.

1190
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,499
I don't want anything more
to do with the police.

1191
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:26,332
- Why go back to all that?

1192
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:27,916
That's over and done with.

1193
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,291
- It's never done with
once you've seen it happen.

1194
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:32,041
I've seen her lying there
beside the road dead

1195
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:33,666
with her head hanging limp.

1196
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,749
- [Charles] Everyone knew
that was an accident.

1197
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:37,207
- What makes you so sure?

1198
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,291
The police weren't.

1199
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:40,499
- They don't know you
as well as I do, David.

1200
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:42,541
Come on, let's forget it.

1201
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,582
Here, this is what you need.

1202
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:56,707
Maybe you'd better let me give

1203
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:57,666
that watch to the police.

1204
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,582
I can say I found it.

1205
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,207
- It wouldn't work.

1206
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:02,249
You said yourself, they always find out.

1207
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:15,916
(gentle music)
(bell rings)

1208
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:19,499
- [Sullivan] How do you do?

1209
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:20,457
Is Mr. Fielding in?

1210
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:22,249
- I'm sorry, he isn't.

1211
00:55:22,292 --> 00:55:23,791
- [?] Be back soon, won't he?

1212
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:24,916
- Well, I don't know.

1213
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:26,582
- [?] I'll wait.

1214
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,166
- Does Mr. Fielding know you?

1215
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,457
- Yes, he knows me.

1216
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,999
I'll wait in the library.

1217
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,749
(intriguing music)

1218
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,207
(phone ringing)

1219
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:51,291
- Hello, hello?

1220
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:52,291
Yes.

1221
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:54,749
Yes, this is the Fielding house.

1222
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:56,207
Oh, you wanna speak to Miss Howard?

1223
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,082
- Barney?

1224
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,999
How many times do I have to tell you

1225
00:56:00,042 --> 00:56:01,416
to stay away from the telephone?

1226
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,249
- It's for you.

1227
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,207
It's the agency.

1228
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,291
- This is Miss Howard.

1229
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,666
Not until this afternoon?

1230
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:10,916
But please do the best you can.

1231
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,207
We need a made as soon as possible.

1232
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:14,041
Thank you.

1233
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:14,957
Goodbye.

1234
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,416
- Good morning, Mr. Fielding.

1235
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,041
Guess you know why I'm here.

1236
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,082
- Do I?

1237
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,582
- I'm working on the Salem Alley murder.

1238
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:31,999
We got a phone call about that watch.

1239
00:56:32,042 --> 00:56:34,541
Any particular reason why
you didn't bring it in?

1240
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:36,541
- Suppose I haven't got it.

1241
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,707
- I heard different.

1242
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,291
Come on, Mr. Fielding.

1243
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,957
You can't withhold
evidence from the police.

1244
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:46,207
You ought to know that
better than most people.

1245
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:47,291
- I know what police evidence

1246
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,249
is worth better than most people.

1247
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:50,749
You taught me that, Sullivan.

1248
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,082
- Did I?

1249
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,041
Well, your wife's death

1250
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:56,791
had to be investigated. Mr. Fielding,

1251
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,791
just like any other death,

1252
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:03,916
for such things as planned
accidents, dark nights,

1253
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:06,791
a road is slick, there's a fog,

1254
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,541
car goes over an embankment.

1255
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:14,541
This woman in Salem Alley,

1256
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,957
her neck was broken, too.

1257
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,916
All she did was fall off the
sidewalk into the gutter.

1258
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:26,749
Well, that couldn't have been an accident.

1259
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,416
Could it?

1260
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,749
- Why ask me?

1261
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:31,791
You don't think I knew this woman, do you?

1262
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,749
I never saw her alive or dead.

1263
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:34,791
- It's possible.

1264
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:37,082
It's the same.

1265
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,207
You had her watch.

1266
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,832
According to my information.

1267
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,082
- Maybe you better check your information.

1268
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,499
- Okay, Mr. Fielding.

1269
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:46,582
Don't ever think I won't.

1270
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:51,291
When I do, I'll be back.

1271
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:52,582
- Sure, anytime.

1272
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,332
Just break a window and climb in.

1273
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,332
- No, I won't do that.

1274
00:57:56,458 --> 00:58:00,457
I'll just ring the bell and
somebody will let me in,

1275
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,541
just like they did this time.

1276
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:03,499
Bye.

1277
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:07,249
- Mr. Fielding-

1278
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,457
- I guess he was right at that.

1279
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,832
- Well, I couldn't very-
- Forget it.

1280
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:11,999
How soon can you pack
and be ready to leave?

1281
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:12,832
- Leave?

1282
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:15,249
- Yes, I wanna get Barney and
Ellen outta here right away.

1283
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:16,832
You might have thought a
little about the children

1284
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,416
before you called the police.

1285
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,166
There's a train at 8:20.

1286
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,666
- Very well, we'll be ready.

1287
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:27,707
David?

1288
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,166
- Yes?

1289
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,541
- Do you really think I called the police?

1290
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:33,249
- What do you expect me to think?

1291
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:42,207
- I'm not going to Grandma's.

1292
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,916
- You are too!
- I'm not going anywhere.

1293
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,707
- Isn't he difficult, Miss Liz?

1294
00:58:46,792 --> 00:58:48,082
- Oh, he's just being silly.

1295
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:49,582
Of course he'll go.

1296
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,832
- When we get there. We can ride the pony.

1297
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:53,166
- Has Grandma got a pony?

1298
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:53,999
- It's my pony.

1299
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:55,499
She gave it to me and I
ride him every morning.

1300
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:57,041
(bell rings)

1301
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,791
Shall I open it?
- No, I'll go.

1302
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:00,707
- He's my pony too.

1303
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,332
Grandma said I could ride him.

1304
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,791
- Good afternoon.

1305
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,249
Is this the fielding house?
- Yes.

1306
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:09,957
- You're looking for a
general house worker?

1307
00:59:10,042 --> 00:59:11,041
- Won't you come in?

1308
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:22,999
- You go upstairs, children.

1309
00:59:23,042 --> 00:59:23,791
Start packing.

1310
00:59:23,917 --> 00:59:24,832
I'll be with you in a moment.

1311
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,041
- Yes, Miss Howard.

1312
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:28,999
- Did you bring references?

1313
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:30,457
- I've never done housework before.

1314
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,499
I worked in an office and
then my eyes went bad on me.

1315
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:35,666
- We need somebody to clean and serve.

1316
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,499
- Then it's no use.

1317
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:37,541
I couldn't serve.

1318
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:38,999
- Perhaps you won't need to.

1319
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:39,999
There won't be much to do.

1320
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:42,791
Mr. Fielding will be alone
in the house for a few days.

1321
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,249
Would you like to try it?

1322
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:45,541
- I might as well.

1323
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:46,332
- What's your name?

1324
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:47,541
- Mary Saunders.

1325
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,916
- I'll show you your room.

1326
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:51,291
- Ouch.

1327
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:53,166
Ouch, Barney, you're hurting me.

1328
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,541
- Then promise you won't tell.

1329
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:56,082
- I promise.

1330
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:56,957
- Say it.

1331
00:59:57,042 --> 00:59:58,916
Say, "I promise, cross my heart,

1332
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,582
and hope to die in a cell full of rats."

1333
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:03,541
- I promise, cross my heart and hope

1334
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:05,582
to die in a cellar full of rats.

1335
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:11,249
- David, I have to talk to you.

1336
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:12,707
- Here are the tickets.

1337
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,957
I've wired my mother you're coming.

1338
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:15,207
I'll drive you to the train.

1339
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,416
- David-
- You'll like my mother.

1340
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,707
She'll try and spoil you the
way she does the children.

1341
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:20,749
Be quite a change for you

1342
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:23,041
after what you've gone
through in this house.

1343
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:26,707
- David, listen to me.

1344
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:27,999
I didn't call the police.

1345
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:28,791
- It's all right.

1346
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:29,666
- It isn't all right.

1347
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,041
I won't have you thinking that about me.

1348
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:32,541
- Why should you care? What I think?

1349
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:34,249
- But I do care.
(phone ringing)

1350
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,332
And what I said last
night, David, wasn't true.

1351
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:37,291
It can't be.

1352
01:00:38,667 --> 01:00:40,207
- Hello?

1353
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,666
Well, this is Mr. Fielding.

1354
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,332
What?

1355
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:45,832
Maybe tomorrow?

1356
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,166
Yes, I'll tell Miss Howard.

1357
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,291
Right.

1358
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:51,416
- Who was that?

1359
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,332
- The employment agency.

1360
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:54,791
Something about a maid they
haven't been able to send.

1361
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,666
- They haven't sent anybody?

1362
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,291
- Or what's the matter?
- Then how did that girl...

1363
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:02,582
David, what does Maxine look like?

1364
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,249
- Maxine?

1365
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:06,916
- You were a good boy
to call me about Lily.

1366
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,999
You sure you haven't told anyone Barney?

1367
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:11,249
- I didn't see it work to
anybody, cross my heart.

1368
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,166
- You were a good boy.

1369
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,457
- Ellen told something.

1370
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,291
- Ellen?

1371
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,082
What did she say?

1372
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,582
- [Barney] Told about the watch.

1373
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:18,666
- What watch, Barney?

1374
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,957
- The one the old woman dropped.

1375
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:22,499
I saw her and I saw him run after her too.

1376
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:23,999
The man from the empty house,

1377
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:25,916
that was him who killed her.

1378
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,999
- Killed her?

1379
01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:28,249
Barney, you didn't see that?

1380
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:29,082
- Did so.

1381
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:30,291
He came out of our house and chased her,

1382
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:31,499
honest he did.

1383
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:34,207
(David knocking)

1384
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,416
- Go to your room, Barney.

1385
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,041
- So, you did tell him I was here?

1386
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:38,249
- Come on Son, out.

1387
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:44,166
I thought I told you to
stay away from this house.

1388
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,082
- Yes.

1389
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:46,166
I like your house.

1390
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,249
- I'll give you just five
minutes to get out of it.

1391
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:49,457
- What's the hurry?

1392
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,416
You need help, don't you?

1393
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,291
The new governess said so.

1394
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,541
Not bad is she?

1395
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,332
- Come on, get your things together.

1396
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:57,291
Is this all you brought?

1397
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,499
- I wasn't intending to stay.

1398
01:01:58,542 --> 01:02:00,957
I just dropped in to look around.

1399
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,457
I'm a girl that likes
to know what goes on.

1400
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:04,749
- You've done all the
looking around you're

1401
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,082
gonna do in this house.

1402
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:07,957
- Maybe. I've done all I need to.

1403
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,041
You'd be surprised what I've
got out of this little visit.

1404
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,332
The nice thing about information is,

1405
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:15,791
there are such a lot of
things you can do with it,

1406
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,791
besides giving it to the cops.

1407
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:20,332
- Well, look out you
don't cut your with it.

1408
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:21,249
Now, get out.

1409
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,749
- I'll go when I'm ready.

1410
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,582
(dramatic music)

1411
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:41,082
(dial spinning)

1412
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:44,749
- Miss Liz, What I do?

1413
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:46,416
This bag won't close.

1414
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,166
- All right, dear, I'll help you.

1415
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,832
(anticipatory music)

1416
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,749
- Maxine, don't go.

1417
01:03:06,792 --> 01:03:07,791
I don't want you to go.

1418
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,416
- Get outta my way, tattletale.

1419
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,499
- You said I was a good boy.

1420
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:11,707
I told you I would chase the old woman.

1421
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:12,749
- You shut your big mouth.

1422
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:14,749
- I did too, see me come
outta her house and chase-

1423
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,749
- Shut up!

1424
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:20,541
- Barney-

1425
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:22,582
- I did everything she told me.

1426
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:25,957
I opened the door for him every night.

1427
01:03:27,042 --> 01:03:29,249
I was a good boy, and then she hit me.

1428
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:31,082
- Oh, please don't cry, Barney.

1429
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:36,041
Go to your room dear and
wait 'til I come back...

1430
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:37,332
- She's my enemy.

1431
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:38,332
I hate her.

1432
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:42,249
- David?

1433
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,291
- David?

1434
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:48,082
(dramatic music)

1435
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:48,999
Maxine?

1436
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:55,791
Maxine?

1437
01:03:55,917 --> 01:03:57,499
(music intensifies)

1438
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,416
Maxine?

1439
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:07,791
(dramatic music)

1440
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,916
(music continues)

1441
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,291
Open up, Dr. Evans!

1442
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:44,457
(fists pounding)

1443
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,791
- Miss Howard, whatever's the matter?

1444
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:46,707
- She's lying out there.

1445
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:47,749
She's dead!
- Who?

1446
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:48,582
What do you mean?

1447
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:49,624
- Miss Howard, what is it?

1448
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:50,791
What are you talking about?

1449
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:51,957
- I knew something would happen.

1450
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,791
He wouldn't listen.

1451
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:54,499
No one would listen to me-
- Stop that!

1452
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:56,749
Now, try and tell me what happened?

1453
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:57,832
- He's killed Maxine.

1454
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:59,291
She's lying out there.

1455
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:03,582
- Okay.

1456
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:09,707
- Know anybody who had it
in for this dame, Doctor?

1457
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:11,499
- I hardly knew her.

1458
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:12,416
- I did.

1459
01:05:14,292 --> 01:05:15,832
You seen Fielding around?

1460
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:16,749
- No, why?

1461
01:05:18,083 --> 01:05:19,791
- I just asked.

1462
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,832
- Don't be a fool, Sullivan.

1463
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:23,582
- Is that what I am?

1464
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:27,041
(brakes squealing)
(engine rumbling)

1465
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:30,291
(doorbell rings)

1466
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:31,291
Mr. Fielding, please.

1467
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:32,582
- [Liz] He went out.

1468
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:34,457
- You know where I can find him?
It's important.

1469
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:35,541
- [Liz] No.

1470
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:37,416
- When did he go out?

1471
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,666
- Quite awhile ago.

1472
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:41,041
- [Sullivan] Could you be a
little more definite, please?

1473
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,957
- An hour at least.

1474
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:43,832
- Thank you.

1475
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:49,332
(soft music)

1476
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,082
- Can we go to Grandma's tomorrow?

1477
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:57,916
- Yes, dear.
Now, go to sleep.

1478
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,207
Goodnight.

1479
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,416
- Goodnight, Miss Liz.

1480
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:03,666
- Miss Liz?

1481
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:04,749
- [Liz] Yes, Barney?

1482
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:11,041
- You're not my enemy anymore.

1483
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:11,916
- I never was.

1484
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,291
You should have known that.

1485
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:14,791
- I'm a bad boy.

1486
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,207
- No, you're not.

1487
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:16,999
- Yes, I am.

1488
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:18,999
I'm as bad as I can be.

1489
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:19,791
- Oh, Barney,

1490
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:21,082
- [Charles] Miss Howard?

1491
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:24,291
- Try to go to sleep now, Barney.

1492
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,499
- [Charles] Can you come down, please?

1493
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:26,541
- [Liz] Yes, Doctor.

1494
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:30,332
- Did you check all the
windows and the back door?

1495
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:31,832
- Yes, Doctor.
Everything's locked.

1496
01:06:31,917 --> 01:06:33,499
- All right, Budge, you
better get back to the office.

1497
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:34,457
- Yes, Doctor.

1498
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:38,457
- Still no sign of David?

1499
01:06:38,542 --> 01:06:39,749
- No.

1500
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:40,999
I wish I knew where he was.

1501
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:41,832
- Oh, don't worry.

1502
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:43,749
I can give the police all
the information they need,

1503
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:44,999
and they have till tomorrow.

1504
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,416
Mrs. Tygarth is here.

1505
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,749
She insisted on coming over.

1506
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,041
- You poor dear.

1507
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:51,457
If I'd known you were here
alone, I'd have come sooner.

1508
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,499
- Oh, stop fussing, Marian.

1509
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,082
Miss Howard will be all right, won't you?

1510
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,416
- Yes, thank you.

1511
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,291
- Good girl.

1512
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:01,999
You'd better bolt this door.

1513
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,041
I'll look in later.

1514
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,332
- [Liz] It's so quiet out there now.

1515
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,332
And just a little while ago, she-

1516
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:12,291
- [Marian] Close the door, dear.

1517
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:13,916
Try not to think about it.

1518
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,249
- It was kind of you
to come, Mrs. Tygarth.

1519
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,082
- I was only too glad to.

1520
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:24,707
- There's a fire in the living room.

1521
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,916
- Oh, how nice.

1522
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,999
It's turned quite cold tonight.

1523
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:30,832
- If only I could have
gotten to her sooner.

1524
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:32,541
- No, please, my dear.

1525
01:07:32,667 --> 01:07:34,666
- He must have been
waiting out there for her,

1526
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,832
if only she had told somebody who he was.

1527
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:39,082
- You mustn't talk about it anymore.

1528
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:42,082
Why, what a lovely fire.

1529
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:44,916
Nice and cosy in here.

1530
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,541
I always did like this house
when I lived next door.

1531
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,999
12 years is a long time, isn't it?

1532
01:07:53,042 --> 01:07:53,999
- Yes, it is.

1533
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:01,332
(coins clinking)

1534
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:08,082
- You're still worrying, aren't you?

1535
01:08:09,542 --> 01:08:11,041
- Yes, I suppose I am.

1536
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:12,749
- It's about the children, isn't it?

1537
01:08:12,792 --> 01:08:14,916
Don't you want to go up and
see if they're all right?

1538
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,332
- No, I'm sure they're asleep.

1539
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:17,916
- Oh, well do go.

1540
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,916
You mustn't treat me
like company, my dear.

1541
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,707
(phone ringing)

1542
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:22,582
You better answer that.

1543
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,207
It might be David.

1544
01:08:24,292 --> 01:08:29,249
(anticipatory music)
(ringing continues)

1545
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:56,957
(music continues)

1546
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,041
(music intensifies)

1547
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,832
- I'm going to give him back my wages.

1548
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,207
- Do you know where he is?

1549
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:26,999
- No.

1550
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,582
- Then how will you
give him back his money?

1551
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:31,749
- I'm going to leave it
for him in the empty house.

1552
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:34,707
(music continues)

1553
01:09:44,917 --> 01:09:47,666
(dramatic music)

1554
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:55,999
(light piano music playing)

1555
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,207
- Was it David?

1556
01:10:01,292 --> 01:10:02,416
- No, it wasn't.

1557
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:05,499
That's the tune the
hurdy-gurdy was playing.

1558
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:08,582
But I thought you said you hated it.

1559
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,999
- Oh (chuckles), I was just being silly.

1560
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,416
It's really a lovely old tune.

1561
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,541
Do you know it?

1562
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,249
- I haven't played it in ages.

1563
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:21,041
(light piano music playing)

1564
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,291
Now I remember it.

1565
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,582
- That's it.

1566
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:26,041
Please play the rest of it.

1567
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,791
(playing continues)

1568
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:50,791
That's lovely, my dear.

1569
01:10:51,792 --> 01:10:54,166
Even though it does bring
back that last night,

1570
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,499
my husband and I had
been quarrelling all day.

1571
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:59,499
It was horrible.

1572
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,166
And all day the sound of
the hammering had gone on.

1573
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:04,291
- Hammering?
(playing stops)

1574
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:05,707
- Oh, please go on playing.

1575
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:08,416
They were boarding up the windows.

1576
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,582
We were leaving early in the morning.

1577
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,749
The Commodore had sent the servants away.

1578
01:11:12,792 --> 01:11:16,499
It was almost as though
he'd planned it himself.

1579
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:19,499
The next morning I locked up the house

1580
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:22,332
and said that my husband
had gone on ahead.

1581
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,291
- But Mrs. Tygarth, didn't you tell me

1582
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:25,832
your husband had died abroad?

1583
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:29,916
- How could he?

1584
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:32,707
He never went abroad.

1585
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:34,041
He never went away at all.

1586
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,332
He died in that house,

1587
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:40,082
and the man who killed
him is in there now.

1588
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:42,957
(playing stops)

1589
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:50,166
Don't stop, even for a moment.

1590
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,791
I told him I'd keep you playing.

1591
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:53,916
If that piano stops,
he'll start back here.

1592
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,666
He'll kill us, the way
he killed the others.

1593
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:59,791
(playing continues)

1594
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,999
(playing continues)

1595
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,582
The murderer's never sure.

1596
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:37,166
He had to go back just once more.

1597
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,499
And tonight was his last chance.

1598
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,541
He made me help him.

1599
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:43,791
He thinks I wouldn't dare give him away.

1600
01:12:43,917 --> 01:12:44,999
He thinks I'm afraid.

1601
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:48,166
He'll find out how afraid I am.

1602
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,582
Keep right on playing.

1603
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:52,082
I'm going to call the police.

1604
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:53,749
It's our only chance,

1605
01:12:53,792 --> 01:12:56,166
the only way to keep him
in there until they come.

1606
01:12:56,250 --> 01:13:01,249
(playing continues)
(pensive music)

1607
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,999
(music continues)
(playing continues)

1608
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:35,041
(suspenseful music)
(playing continues)

1609
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:58,541
- Miss Liz?

1610
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:00,041
- Ellen, what are you doing here?

1611
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:01,666
- I'm lonely.

1612
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:02,999
- [Liz] Where's Barney?

1613
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:05,041
- He's gone to the empty house.

1614
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,749
- The empty house?

1615
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,082
Are you sure?

1616
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:09,749
- Mm hm.

1617
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:11,791
- Sit down, Ellen.

1618
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:15,416
Now play your piece, the
one you play so nicely.

1619
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,291
- Yes, Miss Liz.

1620
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:21,999
(light piano music playing)

1621
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:25,541
- That's right, dear.

1622
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:29,166
Now, just keep on playing
until I come back.

1623
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:34,249
(pensive music)
(playing continues)

1624
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,499
(music intensifies)

1625
01:15:01,542 --> 01:15:04,499
- Blood isn't so easy to get rid of is it?

1626
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,416
Even after 12 years.

1627
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:09,207
But you've done it, haven't you?

1628
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,416
It's all gone.

1629
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,666
Every trace of it.

1630
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,082
And when they open these windows tomorrow,

1631
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:15,207
nobody will ever dream

1632
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:17,999
that an old man was murdered in this room.

1633
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:21,207
It was worth coming back for, wasn't it?

1634
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:26,249
One last time to be
sure, to feel quite safe.

1635
01:15:27,417 --> 01:15:29,999
You'd feel even safer if you killed me

1636
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:32,999
the way you killed that old woman

1637
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:34,291
when she saw you come out of here

1638
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:36,832
and that girl tonight
because she knew too much.

1639
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,041
I'd be next, I suppose.

1640
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,082
Well, it isn't going to be like that.

1641
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:44,707
They're going to find you
here with this gun beside you

1642
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,957
and that'll tell them
all they need to know.

1643
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,999
Take that light-
(shots firing)

1644
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:51,832
(dramatic music)

1645
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:05,666
(Liz blows)
(music continues)

1646
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:08,832
- Barney?
- He's after me, run!

1647
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:09,791
Run!

1648
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:14,041
(dramatic music)

1649
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:16,416
- [Liz] Barney, Barney?

1650
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,249
- [Barney] Don't stop.

1651
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:18,541
He'll catch us!

1652
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:24,207
- Barney, Barney!
- He's got a gun.

1653
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:25,749
He'll kill us!

1654
01:16:25,792 --> 01:16:28,332
(playing continues)

1655
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:29,207
- [Liz] Ellen!

1656
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,166
Ellen, come up here at once!

1657
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,916
(pensive music)

1658
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,666
- He was after me, I saw him.

1659
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,499
- You saw him?

1660
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:46,249
- I saw him just as clear as clear.

1661
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:47,791
- Barney, tell me who is he?

1662
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:49,041
- Miss Howard?

1663
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:53,999
Miss Howard?

1664
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:54,957
What's this door doing open?

1665
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:56,291
I told you to bolt it.

1666
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:57,332
- [Liz] But I did bold it.

1667
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:58,291
- Who opened it then?

1668
01:16:58,417 --> 01:16:59,249
David?

1669
01:17:06,042 --> 01:17:07,624
Where's Mrs. Tygarth?

1670
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,666
Have you you lost your tongue?
Where is she?

1671
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,207
(pensive music)

1672
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:15,916
You mean the man who killed
her husband in that house?

1673
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,082
- And then she said she was
going to call the police,

1674
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:20,749
but she couldn't have could
she, or they'd be here.

1675
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:21,832
- I'll soon find out.

1676
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,791
(dramatic music)

1677
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:33,291
I see.

1678
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:34,791
She didn't call them.

1679
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:36,291
Yes, I know you are.

1680
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:38,291
Well, you'd better get
out here right away.

1681
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:40,249
They're looking for David.

1682
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,207
- They're wrong, Dr. Evans.

1683
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,332
It can't be.

1684
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,207
- Can't it?

1685
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,041
I wish it weren't.

1686
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:46,499
I wish it even more than you do.

1687
01:17:48,792 --> 01:17:49,666
- [Liz] David?

1688
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,791
- I'd like to speak to Dr. Evans, alone.

1689
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:56,541
Please.

1690
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:04,707
- They're looking for you.
- Yes, I know.

1691
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:06,166
Tonight when I saw Sullivan coming

1692
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,249
toward this house, I knew what he wanted.

1693
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:11,291
Well, it looks as if
he was going to get it,

1694
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:12,541
doesn't it, Charles?

1695
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:13,999
- Does it?

1696
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:16,041
- You can hide a thing for
just so long, can't you?

1697
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:16,916
And then they find out.

1698
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,707
Someone always tells them.

1699
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:20,916
You said that yourself, remember?

1700
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,499
- Yes, I remember.

1701
01:18:22,542 --> 01:18:23,416
- Here.

1702
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,666
Coal dust from the cellar.

1703
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,541
- Cellar?

1704
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,291
- I wasn't wearing gloves.

1705
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,957
- So that's what you were.

1706
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,791
- Strange, isn't it, what
fear can do to a man?

1707
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:39,791
Well, not just little things

1708
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,291
like keeping a watch from the police.

1709
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:44,207
Fear could do that to
anybody, even an innocent man.

1710
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:45,541
- I dare say it could.

1711
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:47,291
- But if he wasn't innocent,

1712
01:18:48,292 --> 01:18:51,249
suppose he'd killed
someone a long time ago.

1713
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:52,666
- David, what are you talking about?

1714
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,791
- [David] You mean who am I talking about?

1715
01:18:56,542 --> 01:18:58,541
- I wasn't sure until now.

1716
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,791
- I'm talking about the man

1717
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:02,957
who helped Marian Tygarth
kill her husband 12 years ago.

1718
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:06,249
You thought she was in love
with you didn't you, Charles?

1719
01:19:06,292 --> 01:19:09,082
Then when you found out
the truth, it was too late,

1720
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:09,957
but at least the house

1721
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,249
was still locked up and you were safe.

1722
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:14,249
And then suddenly it's gonna be opened

1723
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,416
with murder still in there.

1724
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,707
And so little time, just days, then hours.

1725
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,707
You knew Sullivan would suspect me.

1726
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,291
You'd seen to that.

1727
01:19:24,417 --> 01:19:26,332
It was so easy for you to use my house,

1728
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:28,999
to bribe my servant, even my little boy.

1729
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,249
Barney, get out of here.

1730
01:19:32,292 --> 01:19:33,041
- Daddy.

1731
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:35,332
- Go on upstairs, do you hear me?

1732
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:36,666
I was in that house and heard

1733
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:38,707
what Marian said before you killed her.

1734
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,999
- [Charles] You're still the
only one that knows, David.

1735
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,166
- [Barney] Here, here are my wages.

1736
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,416
- Give the money to me, Son.

1737
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,666
You're a good boy.

1738
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:46,582
Now, run along.

1739
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,166
(coins clattering)

1740
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:53,166
(sirens wailing)

1741
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:55,499
- Sullivan's a little late, as usual.

1742
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:57,791
- About 12 years late.
(door slams)

1743
01:19:57,917 --> 01:20:01,041
- Well, I was the one that
called him, wasn't I David?

1744
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:03,749
(bell ringing)

1745
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:15,082
- Where's Fielding?

1746
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,082
- You don't want Fielding.

1747
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:20,541
(soft orchestral music)

1748
01:20:27,583 --> 01:20:28,582
- [Liz] David?

1749
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:30,291
- It's all right now, Elizabeth.

1750
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:31,249
- Daddy?

1751
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,249
Are you coming with us to Grandmas?

1752
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:37,249
- You'd better ask Miss Liz.

1753
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:39,832
She's gonna have a lot to
say about things from now on.

1754
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:43,582
(swelling orchestral music)

1755
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:53,207
(music intensifies)
