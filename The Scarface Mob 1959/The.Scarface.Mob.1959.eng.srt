- Get lost.

- I thought you should be advised.

- Find anything?
- Not a drop.

after the unsuccessful raid on the Montmartre,

37

'Eliot Ness was summoned
to the Chicago office

38
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,600
'of the new United States District Attorney,
Beecher Asbury.

'The appointment
was for 3:00 in the afternoon.'

40

$120 million a year pouring in
from beer, booze, women and gambling.

42
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,528
Mainly from beer and booze.

43
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,948
Thirty-five million’s for protection
being paid out each year.

44
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,701
Now, before coming to Chicago,

45
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,079
I conferred with President Hoover
and the Attorney General.

46
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,333
We decided there were two ways
of getting Capone.

47
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,503
One is to gather data to convict him
of income tax evasion,

48
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,297
and the other is to close down
his breweries and distilleries

49
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,467
and make it impossible for him
to continue paying graft.

50
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,469
Now, do you have any ideas
on that?

51
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,722
- Yes, I do.
- Well?

52
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,599
We have 300 agents
in the Chicago district,

53
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,060
and the mob still has breweries
all over the city.

54
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,772
Even run their beer trucks
right through the Loop. Why?

55
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,024
Because out of 300 men,
some can be bought.

56
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,692
All you have to buy is a few men.

57
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,325
What if you have a special squad?

58
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,745
Small, operating on its own.
Every man thoroughly investigated.

59
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,081
Brought in from all parts
of the country.

60
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,835
Men who'll spit on Capone's graft.
Just a few he can't buy.

61
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,255
- You think you can find these men?
- I think so.

62
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,467
Sad part is, I can't be sure.

63

00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,270
- Boys, what are you doing?
- They're taking us in.

172
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,481
- I've never seen you boys before.
- Who are you?

173
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,441
- Johnny Giannini.
- What are you doing here?

174
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,610
Well, let's talk about that.

175
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,612
You that new bunch of feds?

176
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,614
- You heard about that?
- Sure.

177
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,825
- Well, we wanna cooperate with you.
- How?

178
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,037
We never been unreasonable in the past.
What do you say we discuss it?

179
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,330
OK. Discuss it.

180
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,209
Let's just say, meanwhile,
we put the right sugar in the coffee.

181
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,544
- How much?
- I gotta talk to someone.

182
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,923
You meet me tomorrow night, eight o’clock.
Peach Coloni's up the block, OK?

183
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,258
Eight tomorrow.

184
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,468
Hey, uh... what about
these friends of mine?

185
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,096
We're taking them in,
you haven't forked over yet.

186
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,014
Get them in the cars.

187
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,933
You gonna spring us, Johnny?

188
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,269
I'll send someone.
You'll be home for breakfast.

189
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,359
See you tomorrow night, eight o’clock.
We'll make you happy, boys.

190
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,761
It's after ten o’clock.

191
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,993
I said eight o’clock. What's the matter?
You're late. Where you been?

192
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,328
What you got for us?

193
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,750
You know, boys, we got things fixed
around here with the cops and the prohibition.

194
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,337
So, we make it one hundred each.

195
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,380
What you got operating?

196
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,092
Not much cooking around here.
That is about what it's worth.

197
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,600
We all fixed up, huh?

198
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,436
A hundred is chicken feed.

199
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,358
Look, boys, I don't make the prices.
This is what I was told to give you.

200
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,318
We gotta have more money,
Johnny.

201
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,153
I can't give you anything.

202
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,155
OK, Johnny.

203
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,656
Wait, wait.

204
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,493
Guys, you're making it tough on me.

205
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,869
Now, wait, boys. Please, wait.

206
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,747
Sit down, huh? I gotta ask someone.
Sit down, huh?

207
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,338
Hey, Joe?

208
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,174
- Hey, Picco. How are you?
- Come sta, Joe?

209
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,343
- I'm a little busy right now, huh?
- Sure, sure.

210
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,971
- Hey, how's the dog?
- È buono. È bello.

211
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,934
Why, he knows me
since I was a little kid, you know?

212
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,852
- Someone to see you. Someone big.
- Who?

213
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,230
I can't tell you. It's a big one.
He wants to see you.

214
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,816
- Where?
- There's a backroom. We wait there.

215
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,152
You guys, you don't know
what you're doing to me.

216
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,104
Party's beginning.

217
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,064
- You know him?
- No.

218
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,357
(Door opens)

219
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,987
- Where's the guy we're supposed to meet?
- He's coming.

220
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,324
- Who's that?
- Some monkey. He works for us.

221
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,535
Just came over from the other side.

222
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,455
- Chi è questo?
- Hey, monkey. He don't speak no English.

223
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,373
(Knocking on door)

224
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,849
I've seen you before.

225
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,143
We hit your Club Montmartre
last month.

226
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,187
Oh, yeah.
So, now you're ready to do business?

227
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,105
- I told him...
- Shut up, you.

228
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,940
How much do you want
to lay off our stills?

229
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,986
I want a grand a week.

230
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,155
(Scoffs) You cops!

231
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,157
You get more dough out of this
than we do.

232
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,034
OK, so become a cop.

233
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,452
Wait.

234
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,459
(Indistinct chatter)

235
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,214
They're arguing about how much dough
they're gonna have to give you.

236
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,593
- We'll give you 400 a week.
- That's top figure.

237
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,303
How many cops are you paying off
in the Heights?

238
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,055
- We're paying off...
- Zitto, tu!

239
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,725
Who we pay and what we pay
is our business.

240
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,812
We'll give you $500 a week.
Giannini will make the payoff.

241
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,693
A grand.

242
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,990
You don't have to take the money.

243
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,076
There's other ways to handle this.

244
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,084
A grand.

245
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,878
Cornuto!

246
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,965
Ti caccio una coltellata fra le spalle.

247
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,389
Lo faccio ora.

248
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,767
He just asked Nitti if he should stick
the knife in your back.

249
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,192
Drop it. Drop it.

250
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,778
Move back.

251
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,828
OK, a grand.

252
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,052
Leave him to me.

253
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,889
Leave him to me.

254
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,407
(Narrator) 'Ness turned over the bribe
to the Federal District Attorney's Office.'

255
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,451
One thousand dollars.

256
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,120
'Then, within the next week,

257
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,123
'the squad shut down
six Capone distilleries.

258
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,543
'From this activity,
Ness got expected results.'

259
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,552
Che fai?

260
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,515
(Groans)

261
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,728
I gave them every cent.
I didn't hold out.

262
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,355
What do you think I am?

263
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,273
Argh!

264
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,401
Frank, why would I hold out?

265
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,905
I gave it to them. Every penny,
every nickel, every dime.

266
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,865
Mamma mia! Mamma mia!

267
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,542
You get hold of those guys.

268
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,003
Get hold of those guys,
you tell them to lay off.

269
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,215
Otherwise, you tell them
there's gonna be real trouble.

270
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,050
Real trouble!

271
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,887
Tell them!

272
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,865
What's the matter, you crazy or something?
I got you a deal.

273
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,951
- Sure, Johnny.
- Frank Nitti himself.

274
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,161
He made it himself, and now
you go knocking over the stills.

275
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,248
- Lay off, he says, he means it.
- It's still the small stuff. Stills we can find.

276
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,958
Six stills you knocked off.

277
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,960
You guys, you know
what you're doing to me?

278
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,420
They worked me over already.

279
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,798
Nitti is saying I double-crossed him.
He says I'm holding out.

280
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,466
You know what can happen to me?

281
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,760
It's happening, Johnny.

282
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,846
I'm arresting you for bribery.

283
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,348
- What do you wanna do that for?
- You gave us the money.

284
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,225
You're wasting your time.
I'll be sprung before morning.

285
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,728
- I know.
- The minute they hear I'm booked, they'll...

286
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,564
They'll know where you are, Johnny?

287
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,456
Hey... I'm hot.

288
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,375
I'll end up in a ditch, a hole in my head.
Do you want me on your conscience?

289
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,252
You can buy your way out, Johnny.

290
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,506
You cops, you're all robbers.
How much you want?

291
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,967
- Come on, tell me. How much you want?
- Not a cent.

292
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,136
You're crazy.
I ask you, how much, how much?

293
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,846
The breweries.

294
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,933
I told you, we're looking for something bigger
than the stills, something harder to find.

295
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,977
We want the breweries.

296
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,188
- How would I know where there's a brewery?
- Johnny.

297
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,231
- You think they tell me?
- OK, Johnny, let's go.

298
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,066
Hey, wait, wait.

299
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,902
I know one.

300
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,320
One.

301
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,990
I tell you where it is,
you help me out of town, OK?

302
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,493
No double-cross. A deal?

303
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,537
One.

304
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,207
Where is it, Johnny?

305
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,012
(Narrator) 'The breweries
were the heart of the Capone empire,

306

'Stills producing booze could be set up
quickly and inexpensively.

Hey, Mr. Ness.

318
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,992
They got out through here.

319
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,203
They caught on.
We gave them too much time.

320
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,831
- They got out through there.
- The birds flew the coop.

321
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,916
We gotta get the guys who work
the breweries, put them away.

Capone can't make beer
without brewmasters.

323
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,713
We gotta think of some way of getting
through those steel doors on the first try.

324
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,089
Alright, let's tear it apart.

325
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,107
I thought you ought to know about it.
That Giannini we let get out of town,

326

- he got as far as Kansas City.
- How do you know?

327
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,695
Because that's where they found him
lying in a ditch,

328
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,239

00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,151
Now all we have to do
is locate a brewery.

340
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,488
(Narrator)
'In the first week of July,

341
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:13,660
'Elliot Ness's special squad began its attempt
to locate Capone distilleries and breweries.

342
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,704
'For days, members of the squad
cruised through Chicago,

343
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,207
'following trucks hauling sugar or cereal.

344
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:23,044
'Days of running down leads,
piecing together information.

345
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,924
'Observation from rented rooms
finally paid off

346
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,718
'in the location of one
of Capone's biggest breweries

347
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,054
'on the South Side of Chicago.'

348
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,394
Hold it!

349
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,396
Blink the lights four times.

350
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,468
(Tires screeching)

351
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,853
(Gunfire continues)

352
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,982
(Indistinct chatter)

353
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,235
Down the same way you came up.
Go on, move!

354
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,530
- Come on, get your hands up.
- Against that platform, come on.

355
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,324
Back of your head.

356
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,534
Back of your head.

357
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,621
- Come on, get your hands behind your head.
- Hurry it up.

358
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,001
I know that guy from New York,
Frank Carter, a gunman.

359
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,503
I heard Capone was bringing him in.

360
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,922
The one in the middle is Steve Svododa,
Capone's ace brewer.

361
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,799
This is gonna hurt the mob.

362
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,592
Are you going to arrest me?

363
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,802
Sure thing.

364
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,596
- I want to talk to my wife.
- After we've taken you in.

365
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,598
What good is to arrest me?

366
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,434
I am only doing a job here.
The only job I know.

367
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,977
Too bad the job's illegal.

368
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,146
All I know is to brew beer.

369
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:51,192
What have I got to do with some stupid law
that says people cannot drink beer?

370
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,737
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Don't waste your breath on him.

371
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,325
I'd like to see what happens to you
when AI Capone gets out.

372
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,202
He'll be out, you'll be in.

373
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,037
Oh, sure.

374
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,624
I'll do time reading your obituary.

375
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,087
- Fuselli, get them in the cars.
- Alright, let's move outta here.

376
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,755
Kane, find a phone,
call the marshal’s office.

377
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,507
We need someone
to drive these trucks to our garage.

378
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,468
- Come on, come on!
- Flaherty, check the office for records.

379
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,429
Get up.

380
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,265
I can still read.

381
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,552
(Narrator) 'On the night of November 7th,
1929, a meeting took place

382
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,930
'in the office of Frank Nitti
above the Montmartre Café.

383
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,682
'The reason for the meeting:

384
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,186
'What to do to stop the activities
of the special squad.

385
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,479
'What to do about Elliot Ness.'

386
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,983
We're gonna take a vote right now
to see if we're willing to take a chance

387
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,611
on killing this Elliot Ness.

388
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,157
Che dici, Volpe?

389
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,118
Belcastro?

390
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,589
Mr. Ness, I'm George Ritchie.

391
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,300
I'd like to join your squad.

392
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,427
Sit down, Mr. Ritchie.

393
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,763
Martin, the records are on the table.

394
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,766
Ritchie, you said
you want to join my squad.

395
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,434
- What gave you that idea?
- Yes, sir.

396
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,895
Well, I thought I could be useful.

397
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,897
- Have you ever been an investigator?
- No, sir, but I...

398
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,440
How did you happen to come here?

399
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,442
Well, Brandy, that's my wife,

400
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,903
well, she saw your picture
in the paper, Mr. Ness,

401
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,406
and she said to me,
"Now, there's a real man."

402
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,286
Say, maybe you've seen my wife,
Brandy LaFrance.

403
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,207
Well, she's in burlesque.

404
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,379
Look, Mr. Ness, I gotta do something
to impress her.

405
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,755
I gotta do something.

406
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,508
I'm sorry, I don't know
how I can use you.

407
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,428
This is what we were talking about.

408
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,430
Suppose I could get inside
the Capone mob.

409
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,018
How could you get inside?

410
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,938
- Brandy's uncle is the mob's treasurer.
- Jake Guzik?

411
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,815
Her real name is Barbara Guzik.

412
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:39,485
Well, if she asked her uncle,
he'd give me a job. You see?

413
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,737
I see.

414
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,741
Why don't you try to get him
to give you an inside job?

415
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,326
That way,
maybe you're some use to us.

416
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,996
Oh, I'll be a real undercover man,
Mr. Ness.

417
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,372
Let us know what happens.

418
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,748
Goodbye, Mr. Ness.

419
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,750
And thanks. Thanks.

420
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,839
- (Laughs)
- No, he can't be for real.

421
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,757
Brandy LaFrance.

422
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,719
Suppose his wife
really is Jake Guzik's niece.

423
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,513
Brandy LaFrance, the stripper?

424
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,812
(♪ Music playing)

425
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,566
Something for dessert,
monsieur ?

426
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,735
- Cherries jubilee.
- Oui, monsieur.

427
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,903
Cherries jubilee.

428
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,114
Something's been on my mind.

429
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,615
I know.

430
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,910
For once, this has nothing to do
with AI Capone.

431
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,371
I bought something today.
It's for you.

432
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,707
I hope you'll accept it, and me.

433
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,294
Betty?

434
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,673
You goof!

435
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,386
- You didn't even ask me.
- I'm asking you now.

436
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,889
Why, did you think for a moment
I'd refuse?

437
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:54,060
- Darling, I love you so much.
- (♪ Music stops, applause)

438
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,020
For always.

439
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,648
Well, come on, put it on.

440
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,404
Excuse me, Mr. Ness.
I saw you and...

441
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,114
There's something I have to tell you,
Mr. Ness.

442
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,824
Well, see me in my office tomorrow.

443
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,037
I think I'd better tell you about it now.
It's got to do with Frank Nitti and you.

444
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,083
Excuse me, I'll...
I'll go put on a new face.

445
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,715
So, they had a meeting last night
about rubbing you out.

446
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,175
Most of them were in favor.

447
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,470
But Frank Nitti said they'd have to wait
for word from the big fellow till he gets out.

448
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,680
- How'd you find me?
- By accident.

449
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,600
I'm out with my wife, Brandy,
over there.

450
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,395
No, what hap...?
Oh, there she is, dancing.

451
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,153
That's her cousin, AI Kenner,
with us.

452
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,531
Is your wife related
to the whole Capone mob?

453
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,116
Ain't that the truth?

454
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,952
You can't be useful anymore,
not after Kenner's seen you talking to me.

455
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,745
Oh, they know I know you.

456
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,081
The first thing Jake Guzik said
when I saw him today,

457
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,166
he said, "What were you doing
with them lousy feds?"

458
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,253
- What did you tell him?
- I told him you gave me a job.

459
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,589
Then I said,
"Now I can work for the mob."

460
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,634
- What would you do for the mob?
- Well, as soon as you got to trust me,

461
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,220
I could tell them in advance
what you were gonna do.

462
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,060
What does AI Kenner think
you're telling me now?

463
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,687
Just what I am telling you.

464
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,064
Now, tell me one thing,
who will you be working for?

465
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,024
For you, Mr. Ness.

466
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,569
Suppose Jake Guzik
asks the same question.

467
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,904
Well, I'd have to give him
the same answer.

468
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,614
But you can believe me.

469
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,202
There's some crazy reason I do.

470
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,163
I can use you.

471
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,915
We'll set it up this way.

472
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,376
You'll tell the mob that I bought
your story and hired you,

473
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,378
that you're ready to sell them
information about me.

474
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,297
- Now, that's what you'll tell them.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,133
And I'll see to it that you know the things
I want them to know, understand?

476
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,218
Mm-hmm.

477
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,096
There's just one thing.
I don't want your murder on my conscience.

478
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,100
Are you sure you don't wanna do
something else to impress Brandy?

479
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,145
Like joining a trapeze act
or playing Russian roulette?

480
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,938
No, sir.

481
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,773
OK.

482
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,276
I want you to start saving
some going-away money.

483
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,779
You're gonna put it in a bank,
and I'll check the balance from time to time.

484
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,824
One of these days, you might have
to take a quick long trip for your health.

485
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,661
- When do you wanna see me, Mr. Ness?
- I'll let you know.

486
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,955
- You know where to reach me?
- I'll find that out.

487
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,207
OK.

488
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,541
I'm sorry, honey.

489
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,293
We're still engaged, aren't we?

490
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,920
You bet.

491
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,922
Cherries jubilee.

492
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,059
Rum. Brandy.

493
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,771
Maybe it's legal. Pre-war.

494
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,195
Pardon me.

495
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,872
I wish we had champagne, too.

496
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,209
So do I, but it's my business
to see that we don't.

497
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,670
Mm! What a business.

498
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,098
What is it? Elliot, what is it?

499
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,058
Something got left on our table.

500
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,811
- Something got left on our ta...?
- Hey.

501
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,771
Hey, we're gonna be married soon.

502
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,364
(Narrator) 'The dumdum, a soft-nosed bullet,
designed to tear a hole in the victim,

503
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,616
'the favorite weapon of the Capone gang.

504
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,869

gave anyone such a warning.

505

00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,501
'Following the threat against Elliot Ness,

507
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,504
'it was decided to make an attempt,
no matter how dangerous,

508
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,632
'to anticipate future moves
of the Capone mob.

509
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,344
'The only way to do this was to try
to tap the telephone of Frank Nitti,

510
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,556
'running the gang during
Capone's term in a Philadelphia jail.

511
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,059
'So, disguised as trash collectors,

512
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:08,480
'Rossman and Kopka
inspected the alley behind Nitti's office.'

513
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,304
Tapping Nitti's phone is gonna be
the toughest job I ever had.

514
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,723
The terminal box
is on a pole in the alley.

515
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,435
The hoods are up and down the alley
all the time, so I gotta work fast.

516
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,647
Trouble is, that kind of terminal box
has about 150 connections.

517
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,650
So, you gotta have someone talking
on the phone whose voice you recognize,

518
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,777
otherwise, you don't know
which terminals to bridge.

519
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,738
- Would you recognize Nitti's voice?
- Well, I'm not sure.

520
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,074
It'll have to be someone
you know real well.

521
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,243
Someone will have to get into Nitti's office
and use his phone.

522
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,788
- Huh! That's all?
- That isn't all.

523
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,707
He'll have to use it
at an exact specified time at night.

524
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,168
Because I can't sit up on that pole
for more than a couple of minutes.

525
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,920
If they spot me up there,
I'm a goner.

526
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,131
Maybe we can get an entrance card
for the Montmartre.

527
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,717
Yeah, but Nitti's office
is above the club.

528
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,095
And he hasn't invited us
to use his phone.

529
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,930
The main problem
is getting to the office.

530
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,973
The first step
is to get inside the club.

531
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,143
Nitti knows me, Fuselli, Kane.

532
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,105
So?

533
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,941
I don't mind playing
in Capone's backyard.

534
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,405
Who's gonna lend me a nickel,
so I can use the phone?

535
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,423
I want you to get a guest card
from the Montmartre.

536
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,008
- The Montmartre?
- Can you do it?

537
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,052
Well, I guess I can.
Who's it for?

538
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,804
- Frank Morris.
- Morris?

539
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,472
- From out of town, Cleveland.
- Who's he?

540
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,015
- Me.
- Oh.

541
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,852
- Oh, sure, sure.
- You'll take Frank to the Montmartre.

542
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,688
- Can you get your wife to go along?
- Brandy? Oh, yeah, she loves to go out.

543
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,524
You'll tell Brandy the same thing
you tell everyone else.

544
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,193
- You know Frank, you know he's a right Joe.
- Oh, I'll handle it.

545
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,070
What's it all about?

546
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:24,032
You only have to know one thing, George.
If you tip off the mob...

547
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,243
- Oh, I wouldn’t do that.
- You'd better not.

548
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,871
Because if anything happens to me,
it'll happen to you, too.

549
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,414
I'm on the level with you.

550
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,833
Strictly on the level, I swear.

551
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,335
This is real undercover stuff, huh?

552
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,511
(♪ Piano playing)

553
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,101
- Play Brandy's song, will you?
- Yes, sir.

554
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,486
Do they have burlecue in Cleveland,
Mr. Morris?

555
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,655
Sure. What's a town without it,
I always say.

556
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,033
That's what I always say.

557
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,202
Looks like we got
something in common.

558
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,287
Yeah, we do.

559
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,290
We sure do.

560
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,423
That's some song, huh?

561
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,675
Hey, how do you like my friend
from Cleveland?

562
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,220
Oh, I like your friend
from Cleveland.

563
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,806
Oh, he's a swell guy.

564
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,182
How do you like Brandy?

565
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,226
- She's a dish.
- You ain't kidding.

566
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,978
- You ought to see her at the burlesque.
- That's an idea.

567
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,314
Go in the afternoon,
you get seats down front.

568
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,733
Come backstage after the show.

569
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,486
I think I will come backstage.

570
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,700
Who's that coming down the stairs?

571
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,581
That's Tony Liguri.
He runs the place.

572
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,874
How well do you know him?

573
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,876
Oh, pretty good, pretty good. Why?

574
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,628
Think you can get him
to come over here?

575
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,755
Oh, well, I'm not too sure.
I don't know...

576
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:06,426
Just tell Tony hello from me, huh?

577
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,430
Yeah. Yeah, OK.

578
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,894
What business are you in,
Mr. Morris?

579
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,438
I mean, Frankie.

580
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,983
Georgie didn't say.

581
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,818
Georgie doesn't know.

582
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,279
I'll bet it's something.

583
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,822
Yeah, something.

584
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,158
You know who you ought to meet?
My Uncle Jake.

585
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,702
Does Uncle Jake do something?

586
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:35,998
Does he? He's running the whole organization
until Snorky gets back.

587
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,125
- "Snorky"?
- AI Capone.

588
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:41,336
That's what they call him.
Snorky. (Laughs)

589
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,005
Sounds cute.

590
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,549
Oh, he's not my type.

591
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,052
My type is more like
someone from Cleveland.

592
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,680
They grow 'em cute in Cleveland.

593
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,474
You're growing on me already,
Frankie.

594
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,604
What do you say,
why don't we ditch little Ritchie

595
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,647
and get out of here, huh?

596
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,900
It's an idea.

597
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,903
Let's have another drink.
We'll take an out from here.

598
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,699
Hello, Brandy.

599
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,577
Tony, this is Frank Morris from Cleveland.
Frank, this is Tony.

600
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,078
- How do you do?
- How are you?

601
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,748
From Cleveland, huh?
You know Eddie Santis from Cleveland?

602
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:21,168
Yeah, I knew him before the feds
knocked him down to Atlanta.

603
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,003
You here on business?

604
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,504
No, just looking for fun.

605
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,466
Fun you can have,
if you know the right people.

606
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,843
I'm beginning to meet them.

607
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,345
Sit down. I'll buy you a drink.

608
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,764
Your money's no good here.
I'll buy the drinks.

609
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,474
Charlie.

610
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,778
How did it go?

611
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,821
Me and Tony Liguri.

612
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,240
Quizzed me about a mobster
called Eddie Santis, and I knew him.

613
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,494
- I put him away.
- Did he ask you anything else?

614
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,623
He gave me all the answers I needed.
We got along fine, Tony and me.

615
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,000
You think he'll let you in Nitti's room
to make a phone call?

616
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,045
He just did.
I wanted to make sure he would.

617
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,546
How about tomorrow night?

618
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,548
- What time?
- 2:00am.

619
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,883
Fine.

620
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,971
But in case someone's breathing down
my neck, I better be talking to a girl.

621
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,765
Here, call this number.

622
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,558
Who's that?

623
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,561
My fiancée.
She's expecting your call.

624
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,439
OK.

625
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,776
Oh, about that Brandy LaFrance,

626
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,445
she wouldn’t be too tough
to swallow.

627
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,357
(♪ Music playing, indistinct chatter)

628
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,570
Frankie, once more,
why didn't you come to the theater?

629
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,739
I told you, Brandy, I got busy.

630
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,117
Well, anyone who's too busy
to come to the...

631
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,370
What kind of a guy are you?

632
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,498
Don't tell me
you're worried about Georgie?

633
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,333
(Laughs)

634
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,502
You wanna go home, Brandy?

635
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,755
No, I don't wanna go home.

636
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,008
I don't want you calling me Brandy.
My name's Barbara.

637
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,927
- I'm sorry, Barbara.
- Now, just one more time.

638
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,846
Why didn't you come to the theater?

639
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,639
I got busy.

640
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,142
Would you excuse me
for five minutes?

641
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,020
Where are you going, Frankie?

642
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,775
What are looking at, you sap?

643
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,433
Superior 2098.

644
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,235
Oh, hiya, baby.
This is Frank Morris.

645
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,736
Oh, hello, Frank.

646
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:39,658
Uh, I've been meaning to call you
ever since I got to Chi, but I've been busy.

647
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:40,867
You know how it is.

648
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,411
(Lines buzzing)

649
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,380
(Woman)
'Yes, sir, that's perfectly alright.'

650
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:56,508
I'll be over to see you
the first chance I get.

651
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,385
You dirty double-crossing ape!

652
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,887
- You coming up here to call another dame.
- Hello, baby?

653
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,389
Listen to me.

654
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,474
I'm having a little trouble here,
sweetheart.

655
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,978
Nothing like the trouble you're gonna have
if you don't stop playing me for a sucker.

656
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,896
I'm still here with you, sweetheart.

657
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,857
Still with who?

658
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,526
- (Woman) 'You in the right...'
- (Man) 'I hate to bother you at home...'

659
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,371
(Woman) 'Hello! Hello? Hello!'

660
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,498
Baby, this is hard to believe,
but there's someone here.

661
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:32,085
- You betcha there's someone here.
- I'm still with you, baby.

662
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,921
Who are you talking to,
you stinking little rat, you?

663
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,674
Don't hang up, baby.

664
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,803
Oh, come on, Frankie.

665
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,849
What she got that's any better
than little Brandy?

666
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,684
Baby, I'm still with you.

667
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,729
That's what you think.

668
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:53,565
(Woman) 'You know,
the faucet is not working. The chute...

669
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,528
'Come on, I'm sorry.
Let's go to the store.'

670
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,989
How's your sister, baby?
Is she still working?

671
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,741
I got news for her
from a friend in Cleveland.

672
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:06,912
I'll fix your wagon and her sister and you,
you no-good broad, whoever you are!

673
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,456
- Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here?
- I'm making this call, then...

674
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,374
- You're not making a...
- Come on, cut it out.

675
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,127
- Will you stay out of this, Tony?
- Hey, you're asking for it.

676
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,421
Go on. Get out of here.
Beat it! Go on, get out!

677
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,465
I'm going! I'm going!

678
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,677
Who needs you?

679
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,680
I happen to have
a very nice husband.

680
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:30,685
I'm still with you, baby.

681
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,062
(Scoffs)

682
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:33,855
Come ti piace...

683
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,524
Hey, let me talk. I'll fix it.

684
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,403
Hello, honey?

685
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,781
Frank's been telling me
all about you, baby.

686
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,408
(Woman) 'I wasn't on duty last night.
Are you...?'

687
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,369
(Man) You cheap bum.
What are you doing out here?

688
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,039
(Woman) What do you think we're doing?
We're just having a smoke.

689
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,999
I ought to smack you
all over the pIace.

690
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,210
Come on and start something,
loudmouth.

691
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,215
Why don't you come down
to the club, huh?

692
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:05,220
Oh, well, baby doll, it's...
It's so late.

693
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,931
It's early. I'll send a car to get you.
Where do you live?

694
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,726
Leave him alone, Joe.

695
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,562
Come on, you guys,
let's have a drink and forget it.

696
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,488
(Woman) 'I want to explain to you...'

697
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,282
I'm dying to meet you, honey.

698
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,250
'Can I talk to Frank again?'

699
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,129
She wants to talk to you.

700
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,799
Hiya, baby.

701
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,051
This is a swell guy
I want you to meet.

702
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,345
'He's an important man.'

703
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,347
Well, how about tomorrow night?

704
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,058
Like I said, this is one swell guy.

705
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,810
'And I know you gonna like him.'

706
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,353
What do you mean
you're leaving town?

707
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,856
I'll be back in a couple of weeks.
OK?

708
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,192
This guy won't keep for a couple of weeks.
He's murder with the dames.

709
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,371
I'm not making up to any broad.

710
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,914
Not even for a pal.

711
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,751
- Forget it. You want a cigarette?
- No.

712
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,461
Listen, Frank.

713
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:23,298
I got a couple of fresh ones downstairs.
Come on, let's set them up.

714
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:04,881
(Narrator) 'Then after nine days,
the tap on Frank Nitti's phone paid off.

Here's a good one. They're opening
a new brewery on South Wabash tonight.

716

I got some bad news, AI.

740
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,697
We had some breweries
knocked over.

741
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,990
Eight to be exact.

742
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,827
Three on the South Side, including
two new ones we set up while you were away.

743

One in the Heights,
two on the North Side,

744

one of them we took over
from Lorenz,

745

a big one out on Diversey,

746
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,669
and another new one
we set up on the county line.

747
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,712
What did that add up to?

748
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,006
We lost 3,850 barrels a day.

749
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,509
But we're setting up a big new one
out near the stockyards,

750
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,219
big enough to replace the loss.

751
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,680
How about the equipment?
How much have we lost there?

752
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,934
I'm carrying that loss at $3.5 million.

753
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,310
What about our protection?

754
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,439
- Well, Frank can tell you about that.
- You tell me!

755
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:16,114
Our operating loss is gonna make us
have to cut down on the local graft.

756
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,075
But we ought to be able to keep them
looking the other way.

- It's these other guys, AI.
- What other guys?

758
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,205
The feds have gotten up
this special squad.

759
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:28,167
- You tell me.
- Well, it's a special squad, like Jake says.

760
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,212
From all over the country,
just to knock over our stuff.

761
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,839
How big's that squad?

762
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,257
- Well...
- How big?

763
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,635
Seven, eight guys.

Seven, eight guys.

- Seven, eight guys!

Punks!

767
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,615
You two-bit punks.

768
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:03,494
You lousy, stupid, yellow,
stinking punks.

769
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,292
I'm away for...
I'm away for ten months.

770
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:12,045
Ten months,
and we got a problem with this, um...?

771
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,256
- Ness.
- Ness, Ness, Ness.

772
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,343
Well, I've had plenty of problems,
and I took care of them.

773
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,011
So now I'm back.

774
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,472
And I'll take care of Ness.

to Ness.

You too, Mr. Ness.

You've, uh... never met AI Capone,

Not face-to-face.

the big fella has.

Yes, sir, he's got his poise.

And after all,
you get right down to brass tacks,

800

what's he doing that's really wrong?

801
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,347
Peddling some booze and beer?

802
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:12,308
Can you sit there, Mr. Ness,
and honestly say

803
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,894
that you haven't had a drink
since the prohibition?

Well, for one thing, he's generous,
if you know what I mean.

Christmastime,

807
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,861
you got any idea how many families
he feeds?

808

Ten thousand families of the poor
wouldn’t have any Christmas at all

Think he might wanna
take care of me another way?

815
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,343
I think he might.

816
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,428
Let's stop horsing around.
How much?

817
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:53,140
Two grand.
Two grand a week.

818
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,559
Starting when?

819
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,236
Now.

820
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,363
Show.

Two grand.

822
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:23,170
This louse just tried
to give us two grand a week.

823
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:26,549
He's an alderman.
An alderman of the city of Chicago.

824
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,051
You scum.
You're the worst scum of all.

825
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,387
You make the Capones possible
by selling them your office.

826
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,389
Well, scum, I'm gonna pin
a bribery rap on you.

827
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,850
- I'm gonna pin it to your stinking skin.
- (Laughs)

828
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,394
What are you gonna use
for evidence, huh?

829
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,609
That look like a bribe, huh?
(Laughs)

830
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,946
- Alright. Alright, let's go. Come on, Alderman.
- I should have slugged him.

831
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,615
He'd hang an assault charge on you

832
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,451
that'd keep you busy for weeks
defending yourself.

833
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,995
You ain't the only one.

834
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,164
We was driving along,
a car comes alongside,

835
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,000
and a guy in a gray hat
throws this in the back seat.

836
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,668
We thought it was
a Capone pineapple.

837
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,463
Turns out to be cabbage.

838
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,008
That's a lot of green.

839
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,554
Makes you sweat
to see all that dough.

840
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,057
Kind of sticks to your fingers.

841
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,685
I see it sticking, Joe.

842
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,730
It'll peel off.

843
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,693
Sure wish I could get
that kind of dough legit.

844
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:31,030
- So do I, but I don't see it happening.
- Who are you going to call?

845
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,032
The newspapers.

846
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,831
This was thrown into one of our cars
by some of Capone's mobsters.

847
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,375
It's a bribe.

848
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,669
It's a bribe that's going
to the United States Marshal’s office,

849
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,295
and it won't buy anything from us.

850
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,798
Capone has threatened us
and he's tried to bribe us,

851
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,759
as he has most of the people
of this city and county.

852
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,137
Like most of them,
we're a little tempted and a little afraid.

853
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:59,141
We're not gonna give in to Capone.
Not to his threats, not to his bribes.

854
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,227
We're not gonna be swerved
from our duty.

855
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,397
We want every citizen to help us
by giving us information,

856
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,440
by lending us support.

857
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:10,111
We want everyone to know,
especially AI Capone,

858
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:13,447
we can't be bought off,
we won't be killed off.

859
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:23,249
"Today, Elliot Ness and his men have flung
a challenge in the face of AI Capone.

860
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:27,169
"They have proved to Capone
and his mob that they are untouchable.

861
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:31,007
"A few more untouchables like them,
and Chicago can be..."

862
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,431
What's taking so long?

863
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,433
He's gotta find the right wires.

864
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,894
You stupid idiot!
How could you let them tap your phone?

865
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,855
You know what this is gonna cost me?

866
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,315
- I ought to bleed it out of you, drop by drop.
- A, B...

867
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:51,444
- Stupido!
- ...C, D, E, F,

868
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:55,364
- G, H, I, J, K...
- Stupid!

- He got it.

880
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,658
Well...

881
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,540
They got it.

01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,307
Mr. Kane, how are you?
How are you?

886
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,434
- Say, does Mr. Ness know I'm out here?
- Yeah, he knows you're here.

887
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,145
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you, mister.

888
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,397
- Hi, Mr. Rossman. How are you?
- Hello.

889
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,733
Nice to see you.

890
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,276
Hi.

891
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,200
You know his wife Brandy?

892
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,203
She's sporting a rock that big.
Must be worth a couple of thousand bucks.

893
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,622
And Ritchie,
all you gotta do is look at him.

894
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:30,084
He has a new car, an Auburn, very flashy.
Has it parked around the corner.

895
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,753
Alright, let's set it up.

896
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,968
OK.

897
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,304
Come on in, George.

898
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,808
Hi, mister.

899
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,435
Well, hello, Mr. Ness.

900
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,272
- Hi, how are you?
- Sit down, George.

901
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,399
That's a nice-looking suit
you're wearing, George.

902
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,317
- Oh, this?
- Yeah, new, huh?

903
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,028
- Well, yeah.
- How did you get down here, George?

904
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,656
I come by the L.

905
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,700
What about the car you got parked
around the corner?

906
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,703
Where did you get the money, George?
Where did you get the money?

907
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,371
I made some money
on the stock market.

908
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,248
The bottom's dropped out
of the stock market.

909
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:12,084
- What's the name of your broker?
- Hey, what...?

910
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,380
He's just a friend of Brandy's uncle,
that's all.

911
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,466
- Jake Guzik's investing for you, huh?
- Oh, no, not exactly that.

912
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,678
- You're playing ball with the mob, Georgie.
- Double-crossing us, huh?

913
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,805
- I swear I haven't done anything like that!
- You sold us out.

914
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,807
- What'd you tell 'em? What'd you give them?
- Look, all I did was...

915
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,017
All you did was what, George?

916
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,810
- All I did was just promise.
- Promise what?

917
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,813
I'd just find out what you were gonna do
and let them know, that's all.

918
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,191
- But I wasn't gonna do it.
- Why don't you cut it out?

919
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,442
No, honest, I wasn't.

920
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:39,695
The mob never pays before delivery, George.
What did you deliver? What was it? What?

921
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,823
Alright. Just some names
and addresses, that's all.

922
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,950
- Whose?
- It was just yours...

923
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,077
- Come on.
- There were just some others.

924
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:50,748
- And what else?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing else.

925
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,374
I didn't do nothing. I just...

926
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,584
- What else?
- Nothing else.

927
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,586
- What else?
- Alright, I just...

928
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,880
I just drew a plan of the office,
that's all.

929
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:59,006
- What else?
- That's all.

930
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,050
- What else?
- That's all. That's all, nothing else.

931
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,760
- What else?
- I swear, nothing else. I swear!

932
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,346
Look, I just promised whatever they asked,
that's all. I just promised.

933
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:07,181
I promised. I just promised.

934
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,933
George, listen.

935
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,352
Now you're gonna do something
for me.

936
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,522
Oh, Mr. Ness, I'm on your side.

937
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,149
I heard rumors the mob has a brewery.

938
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,776
- A real big one, the biggest.
- No, no, no.

939
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,819
Come on, George,
you must have heard about it.

940
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:23,447
- No, nothing definite.
- Where's the brewery, George?

941
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,115
- Where is it? Where's the brewery?
- I don't know.

942
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,784
What do you mean, you don't know?
Where is it?

943
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,869
- Look, I don't know.
- George!

944
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:33,457
Suppose we let the mob know
how we managed to tap their phone.

945
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,085
Suppose we let them know
how you got our man into the Montmartre.

946
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,671
You wouldn’t do that, Mr. Ness.

947
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,048
- Why can't we?
- They'd kill me. They'd kill me in a minute.

948
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,092
- They'd let me have it.
- We know.

949
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:45,552
Look, Mr. Ness, give me another chance.
I'll be on the level with you in the future.

950
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,222
- Too late, George. Too late. Too late.
- Where's the big brewery?

951
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,474
I don't know. I don't...

952
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,147
Alright, let's just say they got one.
They got one.

953
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,941
They're getting half their beer
from it.

954
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:03,654
But I don't know exactly where it is.
I just don't know. All I know is that...

955
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:16,709
Look, it's somewhere
near the stockyards.

956
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,670
Now, that's all I know.
Now, you gotta believe me about that.

957
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,048
Look, I swear.

958
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,552
Please, believe me.

959
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,223
Look, I swear.

960
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,939
George.

961
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:42,401
George, you're gonna do one more thing,
then you're through.

962
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,195
And we'll take you away
someplace safe.

963
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:47,489
You're gonna find out
where that brewery is.

964
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,410
How am I gonna do that, Mr. Ness?

965
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,745

that's something, huh?

- Good. Come on, Georgie.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1004
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:19,183
- She'll get through in a couple of minutes...
- But Snorky is waiting for you.

they have to try to frighten us,

What?
What did you say?

1047
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,736
I said, baby,
I've been thinking about you.

1048
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,321
You looked pretty good.

1049
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,448

You stinking little rat.

I'm gonna get you and tear you limb from limb,
you lousy little yellow rat!

Oh, that you, Ness?
We got plans for you too, Ness.

The boys are gonna have
a real party.

1061

You told him enough.

1062

They'll never get at you, I promise you.
This I promise.

1063

We're getting married now.
We're not waiting.

1064

You mean tonight?

1065
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,633
We'll cross the line to Indiana,
get a justice of the peace.

1066
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,969
Is... Is this because of the phone call?

1067
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,139
There's a lot of things,
because of the phone call included.

1068
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,476
So, I'm not sure what's gonna happen
from now on, and...

1069
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,186
I don't wanna wait, do you?

1070
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:17,773
Oh! No, I wanna be with you.

1071
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,318

I now pronounce you man and wife.

1075
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:47,552
Good wishes, my dear.

1076
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:51,765
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Joe.

1077
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:56,895
I know you're both
gonna be very happy.

1078
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,730
Thanks, Joe. We will be.

1079
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,524

Miss LaFrance, you know who it was
who killed your husband, don't you?

1083
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:17,499
No. No, I don't know.

1084
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:22,128
I don't know why anyone
would wanna kill Georgie.

1085
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:25,048
He was a real nice guy.

1086
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,676
We think the Capone mob did it.

1087
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,096
Don't you wanna help us?

1088
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:34,641
No, Uncle Jake
wouldn’t let them kill him.

1089
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,476
He wouldn’t do a thing like that.

1090
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:41,439
Are you sure that the last time
you saw him was back in the wings?

1091
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:43,942
He was watching me do my number.

1092
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:45,652
(♪ Music stops, applause)

1093
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,071
He was always watching me
do my number.

(♪ Music resumes)

1095
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,494
That's my cue.

1096
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,331
The last time I danced, he...

1097
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,585
...was standing right there
in the wing.

1098
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,049
Why would anyone wanna kill
poor Georgie?

1099
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,469
He was...

1100
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,139
...such a nice little guy.

1101
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:24,733
If George Ritchie's tip was right,
Capone's big one is somewhere in here.

1102
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,110
We're gonna have to check out every building
above and below ground,

1103
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,571
see if someone, resident merchant,
anyone, can give us a lead.

1104
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:32,198
- Fat chance.
- We'll take that chance.

1105
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,618
- Joe, you know some people in that district?
- I know a few.

1106
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,745
- Let's get something from them.
- I'm on my way.

1107
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,289
Alright, Hansen, you and Youngfellow
start covering all garages.

1108
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,791
Kane and Flaherty
will cover stores and food suppliers.

1109
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:44,920
Kopka and Rossman, start checking
all residents near speakeasies.

1110
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:47,255
We gotta get a breakthrough
somewhere and fast.

1111
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:56,056
Maybe there is this brewery,
but I don't know nothing about it.

1112
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:57,849
- Who gonna tell me?
- Stop that, Picco.

1113
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,517
You remember the old days?

1114
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:02,479
You and my old man, you were
very good friends, you remember?

1115
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,105
Yeah, I remember.

1116
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,525
You were always very nice to me,
Joe. But I...

1117
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,486
I just thought maybe
you heard something, that's all.

1118
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,321
When I work, I'm deaf.

1119
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,157
I don't wanna see, I don't wanna hear,
I don't wanna know.

1120
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:15,909
Can't you just hear this one thing?

1121
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,162
Do me a favor.

1122
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,790
Well, this a favor I wouldn’t do,
even if I could.

1123
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,792
You ought to know that, Joe.

1124
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,627
OK.

1125
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:31,049
- Stay, have a glass of red, Joe.
- I can't, I'm working.

1126
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,968
- You ain't sore at me?
- No.

1127
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,844
I don't know nothing.

1128
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,097
This is honest truth.

1129
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,642
You're the only guy nice to him, Joe.

1130
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:44,396
He likes you. He don't take to people,
but he likes you.

1131
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:47,774
Dogs got a good instinct, Joe.
They know.

1132
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,321
Say, why don't you come
to the house next week?

1133
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:54,864
Have dinner.

1134
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,158
That's nice.

1135
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,077
I'll bring you a bottle of red.

1136
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,079
The real stuff from other side.

1137
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,707
You bring that bottle,
I'll break it over your head.

Oh.

1140
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,757
Yeah.

Hey, dancer. Dancer.

1170
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:19,963
Hey, kid, you're good,
you're gonna go places.

1171
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:23,132
Here, this will help you on your way.

1172
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:25,677
Gee, thanks, Mr. Capone.
Thanks a million.

1173
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,485
- What's your name?
- Dolly.

1174

1175

Amen.

1176
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:56,165
Joe was my friend.

1177
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,209
He never laughed at me.

1178
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,712
Never pushed me around.

1179
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,046
What did you see, Picco?

1180
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:04,674
I ain't gonna let them get away
with killing Joe.

1181
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,010
If I had known
they were gonna kill Joe,

1182
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:10,305
I'd have grabbed a knife
and then ripped them myself.

1183
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,598
Who were they?

1184
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:16,894
It was Nitti. Frank Nitti.

1185
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:19,939
And Volpe and D'Andrea.

1186
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,733
And the big fellow was there.

1187
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,569
- Capone?
- Cornuto!

1188
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:26,696
What did they do?

1189
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,867
Bacio di morte.

1190
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,368
You know what that is?

1191
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:36,080
Kiss of death.

1192
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,208
Which one did they kiss?

1193
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:43,171
Jimmy Napoli was the one.

1194
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,673
Nitti, Volpe and D'Andrea.

1195
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:48,885
They sent Jimmy Napoli.

1196
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,095
Who's Jimmy Napoli?

1197
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:54,557
From Brooklyn, the "Torpedo".

1198
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:59,228
I lied to Joe.

1199
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:02,440
The last thing
I said to him alive, a lie.

1200
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:06,319
He asked me
where Capone's big brewery is.

1201
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,780
I lied, "I didn't know."

1202
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:10,823
But I just know where it is.

1203
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,700
I'm gonna tell you, too.

1204
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,121
Thanks.

1205
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,504
Picco, we're gonna take you
somewhere where you'll be safe.

1206
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:27,340
Come on,
we'll take good care of you, Picco.

1207
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:32,845
What's going to be with my dog?
Who's going to take care of my dog?

1208
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,856
- Here. Take your dog, Picco.
- Thanks.

1209
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,881
Hey! What's this all about?

1210
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,968
- Joe Fuselli.
- Who?

1211
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,972
- Say, who are you guys anyway?
- Federal men.

1212
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,474
- Where were you all night?
- You run my life?

1213
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:21,727
Hasn't been slept in.

1214
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,147
Come on, Napoli.

1215
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:25,815
- What's the rap?
- Come on.

1216
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,817
Wait a minute, I gotta get dressed.

1217
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,069
Just put your coat on.

1218
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:35,199
Listen, you got nothing on me.

1219
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:38,453
I was playing poker with six other guys
until an hour ago.

1220
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:41,247
How would you like a dumdum
right in the face like Joe Fuselli?

1221
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:45,293
I was playing with my friends
till an hour ago, I'm telling you.

1222
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:48,629
They'll back me up.
You can't touch me.

1223
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:50,631
Come on.

1224
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:54,051
Say, who is this Joe Fuselli?

1225
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:59,390
Never mention that name again.

is here of his own free will.

what they're going out on.

at the warehouse at midnight sharp.

- Where?

- Into Wisconsin.

'These trucks, which might have been
delivering Capone beer,

1338
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:34,715
'were instead delivering
a message of defiance to AI Capone.

'With Capone's power to frighten
and corrupt diminishing,

1340
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,137
'people began to give information.

'the mosaic of an income tax evasion case

1344
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:50,689
- Elliot, we've got AI Capone.
- Are you sure?

1345
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:53,108
We've been working on this
night and day for the last two weeks.

- He's gonna plead guilty.
- Why isn't he fighting?

1347

My office is entering
a recommendation for leniency.

1348

You're kidding!

1349
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,453
The arrangement's been worked out
with the approval of the Attorney General.

1350
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,290
Leniency for Capone?

1351
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,167
Our AI Capone?

1352
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,462
Is that what we've been
knocking ourselves out for?

1353
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,255
To let AI Capone off?

1354
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:18,425
- Look, Elliot...
- Is that why Joe Fuselli got killed? For what?

1355
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:20,511
Advertise a man can get away
with murder?

1356
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,930
How do you think I feel about this?

1357
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:24,640
I came to put Capone away for good.

1358
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,475
But this is all we've got,
it's the best we can do.

1359
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:29,228
- The records, the data...
- Not enough to make sure of conviction.

1360
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:32,147
If we try Capone and we don't convict him,
we can't try him again.

1361
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:33,899
It's too great a risk.

1362
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,694
If we put him away for a while, then maybe
we can finish the job of wrecking him.

1363
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:39,655
We've got to take
what we can get, Elliot.

1364
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,240
Just what do we get?

1365
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:43,242
Two years.

1366
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:44,493
Two years!

1367
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:48,205
Well, that's the best we could bargain for.
I feel sick about it, Elliot.

1368
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:52,543
Two years for Capone.
After all this, two years.

1369
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,003
What a joke.

1370
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:58,215
What a lousy, lousy joke.

'Finally, on July 30th, 1931 ,

Will the two counsels
approach the bench, please?

1375
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:24,116
A plea of guilty
is a full admission of guilt.

1376
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:28,453
If the defendant asks for leniency
by throwing himself on the mercy of this court,

1377
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:32,666
he must be prepared to answer
all proper questions put to him by the court.

1378
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:36,003
If the defendant
expects leniency of this court,

1379
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:40,465
he must take the witness stand and testify
on what grounds he expects leniency.

1380
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:43,427
The Federal District Attorney said
that if a plea of guilty was entered,

1381
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:46,680
he would make a commitment
about the length of the sentence.

1382
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,349
I will decide the length of sentence.

1383
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:53,061
- No prior agreement binds this court.

The defendant
withdraws his plea of guilty.

1387
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,250
He will stand trial on charges.

1388
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,260
