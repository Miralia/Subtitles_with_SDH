for some three years.

and his illicit ambitions,

48
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:49,121
became an obstacle
which he resolved to remove

49

53

00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,281
I told you.

357
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,074
But they're so nice, all of them.

358
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,911
Oh, they're all right. Of course,
we've all got something in common,

359
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,996
being in the theatre,
and that's a help.

360
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,582
What was it you wanted to tell me?

361
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,542
What do you think of it?

362
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,002
Lovely.

363
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,213
I was admiring it
all through the meeting.

364
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,590
Your husband
is really very generous.

365
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,800
Peter?

366
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,344
The only thing I get from him,
I have to wring out of him.

367
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,762
This was a present.

368
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,306
- From guess who?
- Oh, I’ve no idea.

369
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,725
Not Bruce Martin?

- Yes!

371
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,562
And he wrote me
the most wonderful letter.

372
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:58,233
It begins,
"To my beautiful brown eyes."

373
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,776
Here, now, read that bit.

374
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,577
Well, what a thing
to say in a letter.

375
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,996
He was always like that.
He just doesn't care.

376
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,665
But what if Peter found it?

377
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,876
It'd do him good to know
what normal men think of me.

378
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,795
Oh, come on.

379
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,589
Peter's a devoted husband.
Everyone says so.

380
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,425
Yes, well, everyone
doesn't have to live with him.

381
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:28,429
I'm a woman who needs something
a bit more practical and attention,

382
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,557
if you get what I mean.

383
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,690
But he must be mad
to write like this.

384
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,358
Well, it's a special letter.

385
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,985
The anniversary of the day we met.

386
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,363
Now, you take my tip and burn it.

387
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,991
It's far too dangerous
to leave lying about.

388
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,244
Well, perhaps you're right.

389
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,373
Bruce is what I call a man.

390
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,625
If he walked
through that door right now,

391
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,168
you wouldn't see me for dust.

392
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,254
I thought it was all finished
years ago.

393
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,256
Well, only because
he went back to Chicago,

394
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,174
but it's possible
he might come back here,

395
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,593
or we might go to the States.

396
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,304
Oh, then what a celebration
there'd be.

397
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,391

made me feel what old Brucie did.

Mr Martin,

401
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,529
did your relations with
Belle Elmore at any time

402
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,823
come closer than mere friendship?

403
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,742
Absolutely not.

404
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,952
When did you last see her?

405
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:37,665
About six years ago,
around April 1904.

406
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,626
But you have communicated with her
since then?

407
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,836
Yeah, we've exchanged letters.

408
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,671
Frequently?

409
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,132
Oh, she used to write to me about
three or four times a year.

410
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,092
What kind of letters?

411
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,053
Good wishes, you know,
that sort of thing.

Oh, I live in Chicago
with my wife and child.

415
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,648
Was there ever a proposition

416
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,359
that Belle Elmore
should come out to you?

417
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,070
Absolutely not. No such thing.

(MEN MUTTER)

00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,789
as you have given up
the music hall stage,

00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,124
I take it you were a failure
in that profession?

422
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,001
Absolutely not.

423
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,087
I saw the opportunity of making
a bit more money.

424
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,090
That's why I'm a real estate agent.

During Dr Crippen's absence
in America in 1899,

426
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,845
how many times
did you see Mrs Crippen?

427
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,181
I went to her house occasionally.

428
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,558
How often is "occasionally"?

429
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,978
Two or three times a week.

430
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,271
At what hour of the day?

431
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,564
Sometimes in the afternoons

432
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,733
and sometimes in the evening.

433
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,027
But always while Dr Crippen
was absent?

434
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,195
Yes.

435
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,573
Did you write often to Mrs Crippen?

436
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,409
Well, not often.

437
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,536

438
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,870
Friendship.

439
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,372
Were you in love with Mrs Crippen?

440
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,498
Absolutely not.

441
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,710
But you did tell her
that you loved her?

442
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,796
Well, I wouldn't put it
exactly that way.

443
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,756
Did you indicate that you loved her?

444
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,176
Well, I suppose she
might've thought I did.

You mean,
you deliberately misled her?

Well, no,
I wouldn't put it exactly that way.

as far as friendship was concerned,

449
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,186
but she was a married lady

an entirely platonic friendship.

No, no, absolute not, My lord.

Once in a while I gave her a little
present. Nothing extravagant.

When was the last such gift?

463
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,767
About a year ago.

464
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,603
That would be two or three months
before her disappearance?

Not very.
How much would it cost, then?

On July 14th this year,

00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,389
I went to 39 Hilldrop Crescent
with Chief Inspector Dew.

494

of the floor had been taken up,

496
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,146

be a mass of human remains.

Ugh, this is the part I don't like.

..from the lower front
portion of the abdomen.

There was a mark on it
which attracted my attention,

502
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,869
and I afterwards examined
it with particularity.

503
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,912
In your opinion, what was that mark?

504
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,040
A scar, a little over
four inches in length.

505
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,834
Having examined the remains,

506
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,919
is it possible to say
whether the dissection

507
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,006
was done by a skilled person or not?

508
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,842
Definitely by a skilled person.

509
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,011
Would the position of the scar
suggest to you

510
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,554
a particular type of operation?

511
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,931
Yes, it would correspond

512
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,142
to an operation in a female person,

513
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,144
for the removal of certain organs.

514
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,063
Did you form an opinion
as to the cause of death?

515
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,442
Yes, by treating the organs
with the usual process,

516
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,278
I found a mydriatic alkaloid
presence.

On further tests,

518
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,156
I found that it corresponded

519
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,033
to hyoscine hydrobromide.

520
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,036
What are the properties
of hyoscine, Doctor?

521
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,787
It is a powerful narcotic, My Lord.

522
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,874
Have you any knowledge of its
medical use?

523
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,293
I have heard
that it is sometimes used

524
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,463
for pacifying
extreme nervous disorders

525
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,381
in certain American hospitals.

526
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:41,052
What is the fatal dose of hyoscine,
Doctor?

527
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,804
Between a quarter and half a grain.

528
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,183
And what amount of hyoscine
did you find in the remains?

529
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,227
From the amount in the organs,

530
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,853
there would certainly have been more

531
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,521
than halfa grain
in the entire body.

532
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,274
Doctor, just tell us what effect

533
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,276
a fatal dose would have
on a human being.

534
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:01,280
It would perhaps produce
delirium and excitement at first,

535
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,157
and then the patient
would become drowsy,

536
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,993
and probably die after a few hours.

537
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,537
Does hyoscine
have a distinguishing taste?

538
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,331
It is rather salt and bitter,

539
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,167
but it can be administered in
something with a pronounced flavour.

540
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,419
Like, um, stout beer,

541
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,964
sweetened tea or coffee.

542
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,674
No more questions.

543
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,634
Taking the remains as a whole,

544
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,427
it was impossible
to determine the sex.

545
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,595
That is correct.

546
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,890
As to the mark you claim
was a scar from the abdomen,

547
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,935
what operation in a male person
would cause it in that position?

548
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,771
The removal of stones
from the bladder, for one thing.

549
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,357
Before you formed the opinion
that the mark was a scar,

550
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,443
you had already learned that
Mrs Crippen had an operation.

551
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,653
Certainly.

552
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,363
On July 15th,

553
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,824
did not you and Dr Marshall
at the mortuary

554
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,994
examine the remains
together for some hours?

555
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,829
- We did.
- On that occasion,

556
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,956
you did not come to the opinion
that it was a scar.

557
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,542
I did not see the mark at all
on that occasion.

558
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,295
Was it not three days later,
about July 18th,

559
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,006
that you learned first
from the newspapers

560
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,799
that Mrs Crippen
had a scar on her abdomen?

561
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,592
I cannot remember
when I first heard it.

562
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:07,388
But it was certainly after your
first examination on July 15th?

563
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,639
Oh, yes.

564
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,016

Miss Le Neve lived in your house
for some time, did she not?

578
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,060
I was her landlady
for nearly two years.

579
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,437
What were the relations between you?

580
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,230
We were on quite different terms

581
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,107
to the ordinary landlady and lodger.

582
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,734
From your experience of her,

583
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,779
did you notice any change
in her manner

584
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:10,201
at the end of January
or the beginning of February 1910?

585
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,869
Yes.

586
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,082
One day, she came home looking
very tired and strange.

587
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,210
Did she display other symptoms
of disquiet?

588
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,171
She was greatly agitated.

589
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,465
How did this manifest itself?

590
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,592
Her whole body was trembling.

591
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,512
She looked as though
she'd had some kind of a shock.

592
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,889
Did she give any explanation

593
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,474
for her appearance?

594
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,393
She went straight up to bed.

595
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,312
Later on, I sat up with her
until two o'clock in the morning.

596

Did she subsequently explain to you

the cause of the shock?

598
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:46,153
She was too ill
to go to work the next day.

599
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,782
I told her, if she didn't tell me
what was troubling her,

600
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,492
she'd go out of her mind.

601
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,953
What was her reply?

602
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,665
She said it was too dreadful
to talk about.

on that explanation?

No.

Yes.

609
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,724
Did she remain so?
No.

610
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,936
Then she started
staying away nights.

611
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,147
And when she came back to see you,

612
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,940
what was her manner?

613
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,527
She was radiant.

614
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,030
Was she alone?

615
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,950
No. Dr Crippen was with her.

Did she bring you anything?

Yes.

She brought a number of articles
of women's clothing.

619

Did she explain where this
clothing had come from?

Yes.

00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:50,092

to Mrs Crippen, who had gone away.

Would you say you had a good memory,
Mrs Jackson?

627
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,152
Not bad.

628
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,488
I'm forgetful about some things.

629

Such as dates?

630
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:16,076
Well, I don't pay much
attention to time normally.

631
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,913
So, when you mention a time
or a date,

I'm afraid so.

you've just described
to my learned friend,

00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,425
you naturally tried
to fix the date for them?

638
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,179
Yes, they were most insistent
about that particular date.

639
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,931
You already knew from the newspaper

640
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,016
that Belle Elmore, Mrs Crippen,

641
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,519
had not been seen since
February 1st?

642
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,937

00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,316
was the strangeness and shock
you mentioned

Oh, sit down, Paul.

890
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,596
Don't be so damned British!

891
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,307
Clara knows all about it.
Don't you, Clara?

892
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,101
She knows what I’ve been through.

893
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,978
Why does everyone clam up
in this country

894
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,605
when you start talking the truth?

895
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,107
You're embarrassing our guests,
Belle.

896
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,317
I'm doing no such thing!

897
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,821
They love me and they've got
pity for the way you treat me.

898
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,989
Clara isn't embarrassed, I know.

899
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,699
Nor is Paul, now, are you?

900
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,118
Well, it's just...

901
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,245
Well, every couple
have their differences, Belle.

902
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,496
(SHE SNIGGERS)

903
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,457
Not the same one we've got,
brother, I'll bet.

904
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:43,420
I know no other woman
who'd put up with it. But no-one!

905
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,755
I'm sorry about this.

906
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,507
I didn't realise she'd had
quite so much to drink.

907
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,552
Who's had too much to drink?

908
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,596
I can drink you under the table
any time of the day.

910
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,391
I'm sure you can.

911
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:01,855
I'm sorry,
we really have to be going now.

912
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,941
Going?
Hell, I’m just getting in the mood.

913
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,276
Anyway, if you don't mind,

914
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,445
I think I'll just pop upstairs.

915
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,529
You know where it is?

916
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,030
I should do by this time.

917
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,450
We really ought to leave
when I come back.

918
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,868
I'm not feeling too grand.

919
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,661
Yes, dear, whatever you say.

920
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,707
You don't have to run off
and spoil the evening

921
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:24,461
just because my little bantam cock
here's nose is out of joint.

922
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,628
It's not that, Belle, only,

923
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,506
Paul really hasn't been
feeling very well all day.

924
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,758
I've something I want to talk about,

925
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,677
and it's important.

(ICE RATTLES)

927
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,473
Where'd Paul go?

928
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,183
Upstairs.

929
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,351
Why, you mean to tell me
you let him go up

930
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,604
to that icebox by himself?

931
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,147
It's not the first time
he's done it.

932
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,691
You heard what Clara said, he's ill.

933
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,318
Just a slight chill on the stomach.

934
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,528
Well, you take the
paraffin heater up to him.

935
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,072
- It's freezing in there.
- No, he'll be all right.

936
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,034
Now, don't you take his part, Clara.

937
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,161
My God, it's disgusting.

938
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,455
Letting an old man like that
go up there

939
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,165
on a freezing winter's night.

940
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,835
I'm sure Paul would much prefer
to look after himself.

941
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,921
Where's the brandy?

942
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,048
I'm sorry, I put it away.

943
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,593
My God, you sneaky little rat!

944
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:17,013
What are you trying to say,
that I'm drunk or something?

945
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,515
How do you like that?

946
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,850
Now, this monkey
keeps a paid trollop

947
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,019
in furs and finery at my expense,

948
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,646
and grudges me
one little bit of drink!

949
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,856
- Now, Belle...
- You take your hands off me!

950
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,149
Don't you touch me!

951
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,736
Belle, weren't you going to tell me
something important?

952
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,279
Oh...

953
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,031
Oh, yes, well, I was.

954
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,327
This is something
very interesting indeed.

955
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,873
Paul, what is it?

956
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,543
Nothing, I just feel a bit peculiar.

957
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,378
I think I'd better get him home
immediately.

958
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,963
Would you like me
to have a look at you?

959
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,215
No, thanks, it's just my tummy.
The usual thing.

960
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,633
I'll get you a cab.

961
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,219
Come along, dear.

962
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,140

I could hardly have missed you.

Now, don't give me any
of those smart answers.

I suppose you're very proud,
lousing up my evening?

972
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:46,477
Any lousing up was done
quite adequately by yourself.

973
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,979
Right, now, where are you going?

974
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,190
To bed.
Oh, no, not so fast.

975
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,776
I’ve got a couple of things
I want to talk about.

976

We'll talk about them
in the morning.

977
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,613
Oh, no, we won't!

978
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,657
Tomorrow I may not be here.

979
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,701
Oh, Belle, not again.

980
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,119
What do you mean "not again"?

981
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,538
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

982
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:09,167
Listen, when I want to talk,
you talk, see?

983
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,045
Don't do me any favours.

984

please say it quickly, I'm tired.

Ah, you're always tired.

986
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,801

making a fool of me

She's worse! She does it for fun.

1064
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,976
You shut your filthy mouth!

1065
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,561

Well, what do you know?

1068
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,279
So the little man's
really stuck on the girl.

1069
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,030
You can say what you like about me,
Belle,

1070
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,199
but Ethel is good and pure.

1071
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,161
And such talk about her
is an abomination.

1072
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,914
She's a cheap, two-timing slut.

1073
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:21,210
How dare you talk about cheapness,
you lousy overblown...

1074
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,256
Why, you disgust her
as much as you disgust me!

1075
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:29,135
Oh, so I disgust her, do I?

1076
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,387
Oh, well, no doubt being
the little prude that she is,

1077
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,889
the thought of you making love to me

1078
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,266
would shatter
her pure little soul then.

1079
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,102
I'm going to leave you, Belle.

1080
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,688
Ah, now we're getting at it.

1081
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,315
That fragile little dream of yours

1082
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,483
would shatter pretty damn quick
if I told her

1083
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,402
that you'd been coming
to my room once a week

1084
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,987
for the past three years,
wouldn't it?

1085
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,614
I’m going to leave you.

1089

Boy, am I going to enjoy this.

1090
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,044
Belle, if you tell her, I'll...

1091
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,170
You'll what?

1092
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,673
You can't pretend it's flattering,

1093
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,675
but at least it's funny.

1094
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,844
Oh, no,
you're not going to leave me,

1095
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,137
or I'll go down to that office

1096
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,139
so damn quick
you won't see me for smoke.

1097
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,058
And what I tell her
will put the kibosh on your

1098
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,644
buttercups and daisies romance,
tout de suite!

1099
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,646
I can promise you that.

1100
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,731
I happen to love Ethel,

1101
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:26,442
very deeply and sincerely, Belle,

1102
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,818
and she loves me.

1103
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,572
I never realised it would
ever happen to me, but it has.

1104
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,285
And I'm not going to let
anything endanger it.

1105
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,329
No, that's up to you, sport.

1106
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,914
You keep me happy,

1107
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:42,583
and I'll forget about
your skinny little friend.

1108
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,918
Wouldn’t you divorce me?

1109
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,629
- No, I would not.
-You've threatened to often enough.

1110
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,173
Yeah, well, that was then.
Now is now.

1111
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,258
What do you want me to do, Belle?

1112
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:55,346
For a start, you can move
back in here and for always.

1113
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,139
No more separate rooms.

1114
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,226
You're not very attractive,
but you're my husband,

1115
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:01,894
and you're gonna lie beside me.

1116

Very well.

1118
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,860
I'd better go downstairs
and lock up.

1119
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,696
Yeah, you do that.

1120
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,242
And don't be too long, lover boy.

1121
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:19,203

during that evening?

Oh, yes,
she was quite her usual self.

She was a very good and loyal wife.

that evening?

1149

No.

But later, Dr Crippen told you
something about her?

1153
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:32,354
He said that Belle had suddenly
been called to America,

1154
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,690
to visit a sick relative.

1155
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,609

1156
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:37,526
Very much so.

1157
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,864
Now, do you recall anything
that he told you on March 23rd?

1158
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:45,451
That was the Wednesday
before Easter.

1159
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,704
Yes, he said that he'd
had a cable from Belle.

1160
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,372
She'd been taken dangerously ill.

1161
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:53,334
He expected to hear any moment
that she'd gone.

1162
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:56,837
Did you hear from him
subsequent to that?

1163
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,298
Yes, I had a telegram
the next morning,

1164
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:04,553
saying, "Belle died yesterday
at six o'clock, Peter."

1165
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,264
Peter. That was the name
by which you knew him?

1166
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,224
Yes.

1167
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:13,520
Now, I want to ask you
about an occasion in 1908,

1168
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,356
when you were in
Mrs Crippen's bedroom

1169
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,774
while she was undressing.

1170
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:21,237
Did you see anything
remarkable in her appearance?

1171
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,446
Yes.

1172
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:26,742
She...
She was naked under her housecoat,

1173
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:30,329
and when it fell open,
I saw that she had a scar.

1174
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,413
Here.

1175
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:33,791
Did you speak about it?

1176
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,918
Yes.

1177
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:38,545
I said, "Belle, does that hurt?"

1178
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:41,340
But she just smiled
and said it didn't.

1179
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,758
Now, Mrs Arditti,

1180
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,010
I ask you to cast your mind back

1181
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,554
to the evening of February 20th
this year.

1182
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:51,183
Did anything of interest
occur on that date?

1183
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:54,270
Oh, yes, we had our annual ball,

1184
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,896
for the Guild Benevolent Fund.

1185
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,107
Was Dr Crippen there?

1186
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,776
Yes, with Miss Le Neve.

1187
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,362
Was any comment made about them?

1188
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,822
A lady came up,

1189
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,782
and after she'd spoken to me,

1190
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,284
I looked at Miss Le Neve,

1191
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:11,537
and saw that
she was wearing a brooch.

1192
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:15,499
Did it remind you of one
that you'd seen someone else wear?

1193
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,795
Well, it was very like
one worn by Mrs Crippen.

1194
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,674
Did Mrs Crippen also wear furs?

1195
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:26,302
She had two sets of furs.

1196
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:29,096
After Mrs Crippen's disappearance,

1197
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:33,350
did you see anyone else
wearing a set like hers?

1198
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:36,186
Yes, Miss Le Neve.

1199
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,233
No more questions, M'lud.

1200
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,198
How long did you know
Dr and Mrs Crippen?

1201
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,284
About 18 months.

1202
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:53,329
Would you say that Dr Crippen
was a kind-hearted man,

1203
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,580
so far as you could see?

1204
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:57,082
So far as I could see, yes.

1205
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,961
Now, taking the dinner party
on Monday, January 31st,

1206
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,339
it was a happy party, as you said,
a pleasant party?

1207
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,256
Perfectly.

1208
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,300
You did not notice anything unusual

1209
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,844
in Dr Crippen's manner
on that evening?

1210
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,763
- Not really.
- Did you or didn't you?

1211
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,599
No.

1212
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,850
He was happy, talking,

1213
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,518
and all that kind of thing?

1214
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,481
Well, he had a slight difference

1215
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,232
with Mrs Crippen about something.

1216
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,861
But apart from that,
he was his usual self.

1217
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,738
What caused this difference?

1218
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,950
Belle thought he should've
escorted my husband upstairs.

1219
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,620
What was Dr Crippen's
reaction to that?

1220
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,080
He didn't say very much at all.

1221
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:38,123
It didn't provoke him to anger?

1222
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:42,336
No, he was always very calm
and controlled.

1223
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,672
Now, taking the ball
on February 20th,

1224
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,508
you rather pressed him
to attend, did you not?

1225
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:50,094
I asked him if he wanted to go.

1226
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,304
And I told him the tickets
were halfa guinea each.

1227
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,556
That was a place where he knew
if he took Miss Le Neve,

1228
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,684
they would meet a great many
of Mrs Crippen's friends.

1229
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:58,602
I suppose so.

1230
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,521
And that piece of jewellery
you mentioned

1231
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,648
was worn quite openly
on the bodice of her dress?

1232
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:03,524
Yes.

1233
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:06,527
He did not seem in anyway uneasy in
the presence of his wife's friends?

1234
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,445
Quite the reverse.

1235
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,447
He seemed very proud
of Miss Le Neve.

1236
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,574
Showing her off.

1237
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,245
Just a moment, Chief Inspector.

1238
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,288
You say Mrs Arditti came to see you

1239
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,290
at Scotland Yard on the 30th June?

1240
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,166
Yes, My Lord.

1241
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,627
This was the first time
you'd heard of the Crippens?

1242
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:24,545
Yes, My Lord.

1243
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:29,258
Did Mrs Arditti explain
why she had come to see you?

1244
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,386
She made a statement, in consequence
of which I made enquiries,

1245
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,805
between that date and the 8th July,

1246
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,890
with reference to
the disappearance of Mrs Crippen.

1247
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:40,185
And on July 8th, did you
visit a certain address?

1248
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:43,856
I went with Sergeant Mitchell

1249
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,358
to number 39 Hilldrop Crescent,

1250
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,694
where I saw Miss Le Neve.

1251
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,028
I had a conversation with her,

1252
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,655
and then went with her
to Albion House,

1253
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,740
where I saw the prisoner, Crippen.

1254
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,618
Later that day, toward evening,

1255
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,579
I went with Crippen and Miss Le Neve

1256
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,247
back to number 39 Hilldrop Crescent.

1257
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:03,000
Did you have an opportunity
of examining the house?

1258
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:06,712
Yes, he showed me into every room,

1259
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,380
and also round the garden.

1260
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,092
I said to him,

1261
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,052
"Of course, we shall have to find

1262
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,721
"Mrs Crippen
to clear this matter up."

1263
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,809
And he said,
"Yes, I will do everything I can.

1264
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,479
"Would an advertisement
be any good?"

1265
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,357
Together,
we composed an advertisement

1266
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,692
in Crippen's handwriting,

1267
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:32,488
asking for information
about his wife, Belle Elmore.

1268
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,406
What was done with that
advertisement?

1269
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,910
It remained with Crippen that night

1270
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:41,079
when Sergeant Mitchell
and I left the house.

1271
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:45,000
I'll send it to the American
papers tomorrow, Mr Dew.

1272
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,544
I wouldn't waste any time, Doctor.

1273
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,047
This could be a very
serious matter for you.

1274
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:54,009
But surely there's
no implication that...

1275
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,262
I mean, my wife made her
intentions very plain to me.

1276
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:01,225
Maybe so. But a complaint
has been made to the police.

1277
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:04,520
So we've obviously got to trace
the lady to complete our inquiry.

1278
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,022
But you must admit that I'm not
responsible for my wife's movements.

1279
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,733
In the normal way, of course not.

1280
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:13,278
But look at the facts here,
as we know them.

1281
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,406
You admit yourself that you're
not on normal terms with her.

1282
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,660
She has many friends,

1283
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:22,037
but she disappears without
contacting any of them.

1284
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,498
Instead of telling the truth
about her departure,

1285
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:26,542
you invent a cock-and-bull story

1286
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,419
about a mysterious death abroad.

1287
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,881
At the same time,
you move another lady into the house

1288
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,426
and deck her in your
wife's jewels and clothes.

1289
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:39,346
As I bought them, I rather
fancied they belonged to me.

1290
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:41,139
Possibly, I'm just pointing out

1291
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,933
how the matter might appear.

1292
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,601
Then you suspect me of something.

1293
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,562
I didn't say that.

1294
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,481
I’m just pointing out that with
these elements in the case,

1295

we can't be satisfied until
we discover where your wife is.

1296
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:54,861
I understand, Inspector.

1297
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,697
I'll see the advertisement
goes in tomorrow.

1298

the wise thing, sir.

didn't you say so at the trial,

You see...

1676
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,768
..Belle and I
had been growing apart,

1677
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:29,645
long before I met Ethel.

1678
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:34,525
She wasn't a bad woman, really,
but coarse and dirty.

1679
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:37,486
Love, to her,
was a matter of appetite,

1680
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:39,822
whereas to me...

1681
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:42,866
Well, I found what I wanted
in Ethel.

1682
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:46,370
So I planned to give Belle
regular sedatives

1683
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:47,538
to calm her down.

1684
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:50,082
I remember thinking
the night she died...

1685
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:54,086
We'd had
a particularly dreadful quarrel.

1686
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:55,462
She was drunk.

1687
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,841
I remember thinking then

1688
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:01,677
that I would've liked to kill her.

1689
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,348
So I’m not entirely innocent.

1690
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:09,184
The thought was there.

1691
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:14,481
They said they found halfa grain
of hyoscine in the body.

1692
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:17,734
I'm still puzzling over that.

1693
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:22,281
I could've sworn I didn't give her
more than the regular sedative dose.

1694
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,159
Anyway, she died...

1695
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:27,578
..and then I panicked.

1696
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:29,872
I realised there'd be an inquest,

1697
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,915
and I didn't think they'd believe me

1698
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,792
because of my relationship
with Ethel.

1699
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:38,672
So I made up that story about
Belle going off with another man.

1700
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:42,301
But when they arrested you,
why didn't you tell the truth then?

1701
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:45,262
Well, by that time
there was such a hullabaloo.

1702
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,681
I was a monster.

1703
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:52,144
Worse than Jack the Ripper,
if you could believe the newspaper.

1704
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:54,938
I didn't think they'd acquit me
anyway,

1705
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:59,193
not after what I'd done to...
to hide the remains.

1706
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,779
So, as my life was lost...

1707
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:06,867
..the most important thing
was to keep alive the thing

1708
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:10,162
I treasured more than
anything else in the world,

1709
01:35:10,163 --> 01:35:13,957
Ethel's love and her belief in me.

1710
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:20,214
She still doesn't think I had
anything to do with that body.

1711
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:25,260
She thinks Belle is alive somewhere,
laughing.

1712
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:31,141
She's a very simple, lovely girl.

1713
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:35,729
I couldn't have borne it
if she turned against me, too.
